## 2. THE DIGITONE II

2. THE DIGITONE II

We’re delighted to present to you Digitone II. It’s the latest creature in Elektron’s history of digital products
with an FM synthesis heart. But for this one, FM is only half the story.

Let’s rewind a touch. Of course, it is a successor to the wonderful original Digitone, itself a descent into
deciphering and modernizing FM synthesis. Digitone left us pondering. Could we go bigger while maintain-
ing the streamlined approach that fits these boxes so well? Could we go deeper while ensuring the joy of
sound design only got stronger? These were reflections that opened up all manner of exciting avenues,
and was an easier idea to posit than it was to actualize. But it unlatched a door that we couldn’t and frankly
didn’t want to shut. To be honest, the prospect excited the heck out of us.

With Digitone II, we dove into the FM rabbit hole and dug up new ways to access that contrary combination
of metallic, organic, punchy bliss. But this Device doesn’t stop there. We tuned into multiple additional forms
of digital synthesis and brought them into proceedings, meaning there is a huge variety of melodic and per-
cussive options at your disposal. It is a multi-machine, many-realm-reaching behemoth.

Our goal was to have something ripe for exploration - capable of impressive sound sculpting but that just
demands to be played and enjoyed. And if that sounds up your alley we think you’re in for a proper adven-
ture. Every single time you dive in. If you haven’t done so already, flick the power switch and get set to pull
your sound through the prism and into a spectrum of dazzling tones and timbres.

Sincerely,

The Elektron Team

1. Plug the supplied DC adapter into a power outlet and connect the small plug to the 12 V DC In on the
    Digitone II.
2. Connect OUTPUT L/R from the Digitone II to your mixer or amplifier. or use headphones plugged in to
    the HEADPHONES jack.
3. To control the Digitone II from a computer, connect a USB cable between the computer and the USB
    connector of the Digitone II.
4. If you want to use MIDI to control the Digitone II, connect the MIDI OUT port of the device you wish to
    send data from to the MIDI IN port of the Digitone II. The MIDI THRU port duplicates the data arriving at
    the MIDI IN port so that it can forward data to other MIDI units. If you want to use Digitone II to control
    other devices, connect the MIDI OUT port of the Digitone II to the MIDI IN port of the of the device you
    want to control.
5. Connect an audio source to INPUT L/R or via USB if you want to process audio from external sources.
6. Switch on all units. Press the POWER switch located at the back of the Digitone II to switch it on.

```
The illustration below outlines the Digitone II’s data structure.
```
```
128 PATTERNS
1 Kit per pattern
```
```
16 AUDIO/MIDI TRACKS
(per pattern)
```
PROJECT

```
POOL
128 Presets
```
```

```
16 SONGS

### 5.1 +DRIVE

```
The +Drive is a non-volatile RAM memory capable of storing up to 128 projects. The +Drive also holds
+Drive preset library, with the capacity of storing 2048 presets. Every project has access to these presets.
```
### 5.2 DATA STRUCTURE

#### 5.2.1 PROJECT

```
A project contains 128 patterns. The project also stores general settings and states. The currently loaded
project becomes the active working state of the Digitone II. From here it is possible to edit the patterns
and presets of the project. Every time the Digitone II is switched on, it boots to the active working state,
the active project. Projects are saved, loaded and managed in the SETTINGS menu. For more informa-
tion, please see “13. SETTINGS MENU” on page 72.
```
#### 5.2.2 PATTERNS

```
The patterns are the primary data container for the Digitone II. 16 patterns are available for each of the
eight banks, which means that 128 patterns are available for each project. A pattern contains up to 16
presets (one for each synth track), sequencer data like trigs and parameter locks. It also contains the
settings on the TRIG page and BPM, length, swing and time signature settings. The pattern also contains
all the parameter settings for the MIDI tracks. For more information, please see “10. THE SEQUENCER”
on page 41.
```
#### 5.2.3 PRESETS

```
A preset is a collection of the synth track settings in the SYN1, SYN2, FLTR, AMP, and LFO PARAMETER
pages. Presets can be stored either in the preset pool of the active project or the +Drive preset library.
The preset pool holds up to 128 presets and the +Drive library holds up to 2048 presets. You can use
the PRESET MANAGER to manage sounds. For more information, please see “9. PATTERNS, KITS AND
PRESETS” on page 29.
```
```
A preset imported to a pattern, becomes an independent copy of the preset on the +Drive
and is not linked to the original preset on the +Drive. Instead, it becomes a part of the
pattern.
```
### 5.3 ABOUT THE TRACKS

```
The Digitone II sequencer has 16 tracks that can be either an audio track or a MIDI track.
```
#### 5.3.1 AUDIO TRACKS AND MACHINES

```
Any of the sixteen tracks can be used as an audio track. This is the default track setting. Each synth
track contains one preset. The preset contains the settings in the PARAMETER pages (SYN, FLTR, AMP,
FX, and MOD) together with the settings in the PRESET SETUP menu and the ARPEGGIATOR menu. A
track that contains any other SYN machine than the MIDI machine is considered an audio track.
```

##### 5. OVERVIEW OF THE DIGITONE II DATA STRUCTURE

A machine is a module within the Digitone II with specific functionality. A machine can be switched out
for another machine in the same category. For example different audio synthesis playback engines (SYN
machines) or a selection of filters (FLTR machines). Every machine has a specific set of parameters
tailored to give you the most relevant and useful sound-shaping possibilities for that particular machine.
For more information, please see “APPENDIX A: MACHINES” on page 89.

#### 5.3.2 MIDI TRACKS

Any of the 16 tracks can be used as a MIDI track. They are used to control external, MIDI equipped, gear.
Each MIDI track can trigger up to sixteen notes per step with adjustable parameters such as velocity
and length, control pitch bend and aftertouch, as well as sixteen freely assignable MIDI control change
parameters (MIDI CCs). For more information, please see “A.2.5 MIDI” on page 99. Any MIDI channel
can be assigned to a MIDI track and several tracks can share the same channel. If several tracks are
assigned to the same MIDI channel the track with the lowest number has priority in case of parameter
conflicts.

The MIDI tracks function almost the same way as the audio tracks. Parameter locks, LFO modulation,
copy and paste commands are available. Each MIDI track also features micro timing, individual track
length and time signature settings. The main difference is that the MIDI tracks do not generate any sound
and the sequencer data is instead transmitted through the MIDI OUT or USB ports.

To use a track as a MIDI track, you must first assign a MIDI machine to it.

1. Press [FUNC] + [SYN] to open the MACHINE menu.
2. Use [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to navigate to the SYN machine category.
3. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select the MIDI machine, and then press [YES] to assign it to the track.

#### 5.3.3 EDITING THE TRACKS

The six [PARAMETER] keys open the corresponding parameter page group which is where you edit the
tracks.

- The TRIG page contains different parameters such as NOTE, VELOCITY, and other trig related pa-
    rameters.
- The SYN page hosts the parameters that controls various parameters of the synthesis engines. For
    MIDI tracks, this page contains parameters such as CHANNEL, PROGRAM, and AFTERTOUCH..
- On the FLTR page, you find parameters for the selected filter/EQ machine and the base-width filter on
    audio tracks. On MIDI tracks you find the CC value settings and the CC select settings for CC param-
    eters 1–8 here.
- The AMP page for audio tracks hosts parameters for the amplitude envelope. On MIDI tracks you find
    the CC value settings and the CC select settings for CC parameters 9–16 here.
- The FX page contains the Bit Reduction, Overdrive, Sample Rate Reduction, and the send effects send
    levels for the audio tracks, The FX page is empty for MIDI tracks.
- The MOD page hosts LFO parameters for the active track.

Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A-H to edit the corresponding parameters. Press and turn a knob to adjust
its parameter in larger increments. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to cycle through the parameter group's
pages. You can also press a [PARAMETER] key repeatedly to cycle trough the parameter pages in that
group. Press and hold a [PARAMETER] key to see the values for all parameters on that page. For more
information, please see “11. TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 57, and “APPENDIX A: MACHINES” on
page 89.

```
### 6.7 CLASS COMPLIANT DEVICE

```
The Digitone II is a class compliant device (also known as plug-and-play). It means it does not require any
extra drivers to connect to your computer or other USB class compliant hosts.
The Digitone II can, therefore, stream audio and MIDI directly over USB to and from supported computers/
phones/tablets. It opens up several exciting possibilities of what you can do with your device, for example,
record audio from your device directly over USB in your DAW. For more information, please see “13.8.1 USB
CONFIG” on page 80.
```
### 6.8 BACKING UP THE DIGITONE II

       - If you want to export projects and presets that you have previously imported from a
          Digitone I, they need to be saved again on the Digitone II before they can be exported.


## 7. QUICK START

7. QUICK START

```
This quick start will guide you through some of the basic operations to start using the Digitone II right away.
First, connect it as described in section “3.3 SETTING UP AND STARTING THE DIGITONE II” on page 14.
```
### 7.1 SELECTING AND PLAYING THE PRESETS

```
There are a large number of presets in the Digitone II that you can use in your music-making or as starting
points for your own sound design.
```
1. Press [PRESET/KIT] to open the PRESET/KIT menu.
2. Select LOAD (PRESET) to open the LOAD PRESET MENU
3. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys or LEVEL/DATA to highlight a preset.
4. Press [KEYBOARD] and then use the [TRIG] keys to play and listen the highlighted preset.
5. Press [YES] to load the preset to the active track.

### 7.2 PLAYING THE FACTORY PRESET PATTERNS.

```
You can find a number of factory preset patterns in the Digitone II. Follow the instructions below to get
started exploring your new instrument.
```
1. Press [PTN] and then use the [LEFT]/[RIGHT] keys to select bank A. Then press [TRIG 1] to select
    pattern A01.
2. Press [PLAY] to listen to pattern A01.
3. Press [PTN], and then press [TRIG 2] to cue pattern A02. It will start once pattern A01 has reached
    its end. Select pattern A03 by pressing [PTN], and then press [TRIG 3], and so on.
4. Press [STOP] to stop playback.

### 7.3 USING KEYBOARD MODE

```
You can use the [TRIG] keys to play any track chromatically.
```
1. Select the track to play chromatically by pressing [TRK] + one of the [TRIG 1–16] keys.
2. Press [KEYBOARD] to enter KEYBOARD mode. The [TRIG] keys will light up in a pattern that resem-
    bles an octave of a piano keyboard. Only lit keys are playable.
3. Play the [TRIG] keys. The preset will be pitched differently for each of the playable keys. Press [+]/[-]
    to transpose the virtual keyboard up or down one octave.
For more information, please see “8.5.1 KEYBOARD MODE” on page 24.

```
KEYBOARD mode is an effective way to add musical variety to your tracks. The timbre,
tonality and impact of playing a preset chromatically depends on the character of the source
preset.
```
### 7.4 USING MUTE MODE

```
You can mute any of the sequencer tracks in this mode. Unlike the KEYBOARD mode, it makes no
difference which track is active when this mode is activated. You can access all tracks simultaneously.
```
1. Make sure a pattern is playing.
2. Press the [FUNC] + [TRK] key to enter MUTE mode.
3. Press any of the [TRIG] keys to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The light of the
    [TRIG] keys indicates the mute status. Unlit keys are muted tracks. Lit keys are active tracks.
For more information, please see “8.5.3 MUTE MODE” on page 27.


##### 7. QUICK START

### 7.5 TEMPO AND METRONOME

Press the [TEMPO] key to open the TEMPO menu.

#### 7.5.1 TEMPO

```
To change the BPM setting, open the TEMPO menu by pressing the [TEMPO] key. Use DATA ENTRY
knob A or LEVEL/DATA to change tempo. Pressing the knob while turning it changes the tempo four
BPM at a time. Use DATA ENTRY knob B or [UP] or [DOWN] to change the tempo in decimal steps. You
can chose between a tempo for the whole project or use a separate tempo every pattern. Press and
hold [FUNC], and then use DATA ENTRY knob E to switch between these modes. On the main interface
screen, you can also press and hold the [ARROW] keys [LEFT] or [RIGHT] to nudge the tempo 10% up
or down temporarily. Release the key to revert to the original tempo.
To tap a tempo setting, hold [FUNC] and tap the [TEMPO] key in a steady rhythm. After four consecutive
taps the average tempo of the taps will be calculated. By continuing tapping, the average tempo will keep
on updating. You can also use an extrnal MIDI controller to tap the tempo by sending note C0 on the
selected FX CONTROL MIDI channel.
When in the TEMPO menu (and with PROJECT tempo mode selected), holding [FUNC] while turning
DATA ENTRY knob A will not change the tempo to the selected value until [FUNC] is released. While
doing this, “PREP.” flash in the bottom left corner of the screen.
```
```
Nudging the tempo is very handy when manually syncing Digitone II to a turntable or an
external sound source. Note that you do not need to be in the TEMPO menu to nudge the
tempo.
```
```
Use DATA ENTRY knob D to adjust the SWING setting of the pattern, to employ a propulsive, rhythmic
groove. The swing ratio can be set to 51-80%. The default setting is equal spacing, 50%.
```
#### 7.5.2 METRONOME

```
The metronome settings controls the internal metronome of the Digitone II. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs
to change the settings.
```
```
METRO activates/deactivates the metronome. You can also press [TEMPO] + [YES] to toggle the
metronome on/off.
SIG. controls the note and beat measure of the metronome time signature.
PREROLL controls for how many bars the metronome will sound before the sequencer starts playing.
This setting is only relevant when you are in LIVE RECORDING mode.
VOL controls the volume of the metronome click.
```
### 7.6 EDITING PARAMETERS

Each track has six PARAMETER page groups that each contain a number of pages. Press [PARAMETER]
keys TRIG, SYN, FLTR, AMP, FX, and MOD to access the different PARAMETER page groups. These param-
eters affect the sound and signal in various ways.

1. Make sure a pattern is playing.
2. Press [TRK] + [TRIG] keys 1–16 to select a track.
3. To change, for example, the cutoff of the filter, press the [FLTR] key to open the FILTER page.
    The parameter labeled FREQ changes the cutoff of the filter. Turn DATA ENTRY knob E to change
    the parameter value, and hear how the sound is affected.

Try out the rest of the PARAMETER page parameters to explore a variety of sound shaping possibilities.


## 8. DIGITONE II CONTROLS TABLE OF CONTENTS

8. DIGITONE II CONTROLS

### 8.1 TRIG KEYS

```
The [TRIG] keys have several uses, including for example, triggering an audio/MIDI track from the active
pattern. They can also be used for placing trigs in the RECORDING modes. When pressed in combination
with the [PTN] and [SONG] keys, they select patterns and songs. The [TRIG] keys light up to indicate the
position of placed trigs and to indicate the selected bank and track.
```
### 8.2 ROTARY ENCODERS

```
The MAIN VOLUME is an absolute encoder, spanning roughly 320 degrees from its left extreme to its right
extreme. The LEVEL/DATA and DATA ENTRY knobs (with which you set various parameter values), are
relative encoders which may be spun any number of turns. Pressing and turning these encoders will change
their associated values at a greater speed.
```
### 8.3 KEY BEHAVIOR

```
As a group, the track selection keys (the [TRIG] keys) have radio button functionality, i.e. when a new track
is set to be active, the previous one is simultaneously deactivated. Only one track can be selected at a time.
Likewise, the group consisting of the six [PARAMETER] keys also have radio button functionality.
```
### 8.4 MIDI NOTES

```
Some functions can be triggered by sending MIDI note values from an external MIDI device (a MIDI key-
board or a computer, for example) connected to the Digitone II via a standard MIDI cable or a USB 2.0 A to
B connector cable.
Of the 128 notes in the standard MIDI range, Note numbers 0–15 correspond to notes C0 through to D#1,
the leftmost octave (which is sometimes called C2–D#2 in certain applications). These notes will trigger the
preset of track 1 through track 16, respectively (provided they are set to their default channels 1-16). These
notes values map to each of the sixteen tracks, regardless of which track is active.
MIDI note numbers 16–84, that corresponds to notes E2–C7 (C5, MIDI note 60, being middle C) will trigger
the preset of the active track in it’s chromatic variations (as if played by the [TRIG] keys in KEYBOARD

MIDI program change messages 0–127 will select pattern 1–128 (A01–H16) on the Digitone II. Additionally,
MIDI CC and NRPN messages can be sent to control various aspects of the Digitone II. For more informa-
tion, please see “APPENDIX C: MIDI” on page 112.
```
### 8.5 MODES

```
There are several modes of operation on the Digitone II that decides what action the [TRIG] keys perform
when pressed.
```
#### 8.5.1 KEYBOARD MODE

```
Press [KEYBOARD] to enter KEYBOARD mode. In this mode, you can play the preset of the active
audio track (or send MIDI notes if you have an active MIDI track). With KB SCALE set to CHROMATIC
and MODE set to NORMAL the [TRIG] keys will light up in a pattern that resembles an octave of a piano
keyboard layout. Only lit keys are playable. Press [TRK] + [TRIG 1–16] keys to select the track you want
to play.
Press the lit trig keys to play different notes. The range from [TRIG 9] key to [TRIG 16] key is one octave.
The whole note range you can trig is a little more than 10 octaves (C0–G10) You can transpose the key-
board 4 octaves up and 5 octaves down from the middle octave. Press [+]/[−] to transpose the virtual
keyboard up or down in octave steps. With U/D KEY MODE set to KB OCT, you can also press [UP]/
[DOWN] to transpose the virtual keyboard when you are in KEYBOARD mode. For more information,
please see “13.7.4 U/D KEY MODE” on page 79.
Notes triggered can be recorded on the sequencer in LIVE RECORDING mode. Find out how this is done
in section “10.4 LIVE RECORDING MODE” on page 44.
Press [KEYBOARD] again to exit KEYBOARD mode.
```
```
In KEYBOARD mode the color of the [+]/[−] keys shows the current octave for the [TRIG]
keys. White: 1 octave up/down, Yellow: 2 octaves up/down, Orange: 3 octaves up/down,
Red: 4 octaves up/down, Dark Red: 5 octaves down.
```

##### 8. DIGITONE II CONTROLS

#### 8.5.2 KEYBOARD SETUP MENU

Press [FUNC] + [KEYBOARD] to open the KEYBOARD SETUP menu. Here you get a graphical view
of which notes the [TRIG] keys play. These settings then affect how you add notes/chords using the
[TRIG] keys to the sequencer in the LIVE RECORDING and STEP RECORDING modes and also in the
NOTE EDIT menu. Press [+]/[−] or [UP]/[DOWN] to transpose the keyboard up or down an octave. In
this menu, you can also set different musical scales, and select the root note of the scale and select
chord mode. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to change the settings. Press [NO] to exit the menu. Press
[KEYBOARD] again to exit KEYBOARD mode. The settings are stored in the active pattern.

```
In the KEYBOARD SETUP menu, press and hold [FUNC] to open the CONFIG menu where
you can select if the settings for the parameters MODE, ROOT, and SCALE should be set
per pattern or per track.
```
```
MODE lets you select how the device handles note input from the [TRIG] keys.
NORMAL In this mode the the [TRIG] keys only play notes within the chosen scale. The [TRIG]
keys will light up in a pattern that resembles an octave of a piano keyboard layout. Only lit keys are
playable.
FOLDED This mode is similar to NORMAL, but changes the way the notes are laid out on the
[TRIG] keys. Now all the [TRIG] keys trigger a note. The [TRIG 9] key plays the lowest note of
the selected octave, root note and scale. The notes are then played upwards through the scale to
[TRIG 16] and then further upwards on [TRIG 1–8]. When a scale contains less than eight notes
in an octave, the “remaining” [TRIG] keys on the lower row will play the same notes as the first
[TRIG] keys on the upper row. Blue [TRIG] keys signal that they contain notes that are one or more
octaves distanced from each other.
In the following example of the whole tone scale [TRIG 15–16] keys play the same notes as the
[TRIG 1–2] keys. [TRIG 1] and [TRIG 15] both plays a note that is one octave above [TRIG 9]. [TRIG
7] plays a note that is two octaves above [TRIG 9].
```
```
CHORD ROOT In this mode, a chord based on the SCALE and ROOT settings are played when you
press a [TRIG] key. TYPE/SHAPE decides which type of chord is played. The chord stems from the
the lowest root note.
CHORD CENTER works the same as CHORD ROOT with one added functionality, CENTER PO-
SITION. This settings is indicated by a little arrow on the screen under the virtual keyboard. The
center position determines what note the other notes should be centered around. This is similar
to how a musician would play different chords, basically keeping the hand in the same position as
much as possible while changing the chords. The center position can be changed by pressing and
holding [KEYBOARD] and then pressing [+]/[−] to move it chromatically up and down. If you only
press [+]/[−], the center position automatically moves to correspond to the next inversion of the
chord, allowing quick up and down movements of the chord.
CHORD SPREAD works just like CHORD CENTER but in this mode every second note is trans-
posed one octave up, resulting in a more spread out chord.
CHORD MEMORY This mode allows playing back up to 16 previously configured chords per pattern.
```

##### 8. DIGITONE II CONTROLS

```
Use the CHORD MEMORY LEARN feature to add chords that later can be played back in
the CHORD MEMORY mode. You can acces this learn functionality in any MODE.
```
1. When in the KEYBOARD SETUP menu, press [FUNC] + [YES] to open the CHORD
    MEMORY LEARN feature.
2. Press the [TRIG] key(s) (or an external MIDI controller) to play and record your
    chord. Press [FUNC] + [NO] if you wish to clear what you have recorded. Press
    [FUNC] + [YES] to preview the chord you recorded.
3. Press [YES], and then use the [TRIG] keys to select a memory slot to save the
    chord to.
4. Press [YES] to save the chord to the selected memory slot.
5. Repeat this process if you want to record additional chords.
6. Select CHORD MEMORY mode to play back the chords you recorded.

```
Copy, clear and paste commands are available in CHORD MEMORY mode.
```
```
ROOT sets the root note for the chosen scale.
SCALE sets the track’s scale. This setting governs which notes are playable on the Digitone II’s
[TRIG] keys to allow only notes in the set scale. For a list of all selectable keyboard scales, please see
”APPENDIX E: KEYBOARD SCALES” on page 119.
TYPE/SHAPE With SCALE set to CHROMATIC you have here a selection of different types of chords
(for example, MAJ, MIN, 7TH, MIN7, MAJ7, DIM) to choose from. With SCALE set to anything but
CHROMATIC, diatonic chords in the scale are created, and TYPE/SHAPE sets which notes in the
chord are used.
For example, with ROOT set to C and SCALE to ION (white notes only), and SHAPE set to 1-3-5:
Playing a C note, this will create the notes C, E, G (C major)
Playing a D note, this will create the notes D, F, A (D minor)
Playing a C note on 1-3-5-7 will create the notes C, E, G, B (C major 7th) etc
You can also use [TRIG 1–8] to select shape which provides a quick access to the shapes and is use-
ful when playing the [TRIG] keys live by hand.
```
- You can also use an external keyboard to play the active tracks preset chromatically.
    Connect the keyboard to the Digitone II and configure the external keyboard and the
    Digitone II MIDI Auto Channel (SETTINGS > MIDI CONFIG > CHANNELS) to the same
    MIDI channel. Then play the keys on the external keyboard to play the active tracks
    preset chromatically. You can play the active track’s preset chromatically even if the
    Digitone II is not in KEYBOARD mode.
BASS OCT adds another root bass note 1, 2, or 3 octaves below the original root.
Setting it to -1 will create a note one octave below (playing a C3 with TYPE/SHAPE set to 1-3-5 will
create the notes C2 C3 E3 G3). Setting it to -2 will create a note two octaves below.
If the chord has more than three notes, it will replace the root note for the bass note. So playing a C3
using SHAPE 1-3-5-7 and BASS OCT -1 will create the notes C2 E3 G3 B3
The BASS OCT parameter is only available if MODE is set to CHORD ROOT, CHORD CENTER, or
CHORD SPREAD.

```
If MODE is set to any of the CHORD modes variants, the [TRIG] keys will not light up
since a chord consists of several notes.
```

##### 8. DIGITONE II CONTROLS

#### 8.5.3 MUTE MODE

You can use MUTE mode to mute any of the 16 sequencer tracks. Unlike KEYBOARD mode,
it makes no difference which track is active when you enter MUTE mode. All tracks are accessed simul-
taneously. Press any of the [TRIG] keys to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The
color of the [TRIG] keys indicates it’s tracks mute status. Lit keys signify unmuted tracks. Unlit keys
signify muted tracks.

There are two different versions of MUTE mode on the Digitone II:

- GLOBAL MUTE MODE In GLOBAL MUTE mode, the muted tracks are muted in all patterns. In this
mode, the [TRACK] keys are lit green. If a track with trigs placed on it is muted in GLOBAL MUTE
mode, its [TRACK] key blinks green when the pattern plays.
Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to enter GLOBAL MUTE mode.
Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to exit GLOBAL MUTE mode.
- PATTERN MUTE MODE In PATTERN MUTE mode, the muted tracks are muted only in the active
pattern. In this mode, the [TRACK] keys are lit magenta. If a track with trigs placed on it is muted in
PATTERN MUTE mode, its [TRACK] key blinks magenta when the pattern plays.
Press [FUNC] + double-press [TRK] to enter PATTERN MUTE mode.
Press [FUNC] + [TRK] to exit PATTERN MUTE mode.

The GLOBAL MUTE mode settings are saved together with the project. The PATTERN MUTE mode
settings are saved together with the pattern.

If a track with trigs placed on it is muted in PATTERN MUTE and GLOBAL MUTE mode, its [TRACK] key
blinks magenta in both modes when the pattern plays.

You can also prepare tracks for muting/unmuting before the mute action takes effect. While in any MUTE
mode, press and hold [FUNC] and then press the [TRIG] keys corresponding with the tracks you want
to mute/unmute. The selected tracks will then be muted/unmuted when you release [FUNC]. At the top
of the screen you can see an overview of the mute status for all the tracks. Square = unmuted track,
horizontal line = muted track, a plus sign = a track prepared to be unmuted, an X = track prepared to be
muted.

- You can also use QUICK MUTE to mute and unmute sequencer tracks. Press and hold
    [FUNC] and then press the [TRACK] keys to mute or unmute tracks.
- Digitone II remembers the last used version of MUTE mode and will access this one first
    when you press [FUNC] + [TRK]. This also applies to QUICK MUTE.

#### 8.5.4 TRIG MODE

The various TRIG modes affect the functionality of the [TRIG 1–16] keys. Press [FUNC] + [UP] or
[DOWN] to select which TRIG mode that should be active. The selected TRIG mode is active for all the
tracks. All actions performed using the trig modes can be recorded in LIVE RECORDING mode.

##### TRACKS

```
This is the default TRIG mode. In this mode, the [TRIG 1–16] keys triggers the corresponding audio/
MIDI tracks.
```
```
VELOCITIES
In this TRIG mode, the [TRIG 1–16] keys triggers the active track with different amounts of velocity.
Trig 1 = Velocity 8
Trig 2 = Velocity 16
Trig 3 = Velocity 24
Trig 4 = Velocity 32
Trig 5 = Velocity 40
Trig 6 = Velocity 48
```

##### 8. DIGITONE II CONTROLS

Trig 1 = Retrig rate 1/1
Trig 2 = Retrig rate 1/2
Trig 3 = Retrig rate 1/3
Trig 4 = Retrig rate 1/4
Trig 5 = Retrig rate 1/5
Trig 6 = Retrig rate 1/6
Trig 7 = Retrig rate 1/8
Trig 8 = Retrig rate 1/12

Trig 14 = Retrig rate 1/48
Trig 15 = Retrig rate 1/64
Trig 16 = Retrig rate 1/80
```
```
PRESET POOL
In this TRIG mode, the [TRIG 1–16] keys triggers sixteen preset slots in the preset pool. The first page
triggers the presets in slots 1–16. Press [PAGE] + [RIGHT] to go to page 2 to trigger the presets in
slots 17–32 and so on. Press [PAGE] + [LEFT/RIGHT] to select which slots you wish to trigger. For
more information, please see “9.1 THE +DRIVE LIBRARY AND THE POOL” on page 29.
```
```
The RETRIGS and PRESET POOL trig modes are only supported on audio tracks.
```

## 9. PATTERNS, KITS AND PRESETS

9. PATTERNS, KITS AND PRESETS

The patterns are the primary data container for the Digitone II. Sixteen patterns are available for each of the
eight banks, which means that 128 patterns are available for each project. A pattern contains up to 16 pre-
sets (one for each track), sequencer data like trigs and parameter locks. It also contains the default settings
on the TRIG page and BPM, length, swing and time signature settings.

A kit is a collection of 16 presets, one for every track together with a number of kit related settings. A preset
is either an audio track preset or a MIDI track preset. Audio track presets contain all settings from the SYN,
FLTR, AMP, FX, and MOD PARAMETER pages, and MIDI track presets contain all settings from the SYN,
FLTR, AMP, and MOD PARAMETER pages. Any preset can be assigned to any of the 16 tracks.

A preset or kit that has been imported from the +Drive to a pattern becomes part of the active pattern. Any
changes made to a preset/kit will therefore not affect the stored preset/kit. It will only affect the preset/
kit in the active pattern. You can export (and in that way save) a preset/kit from the active pattern to the
+Drive. For more information, please see “9.2 PRESET/KIT MENU” on page 30.

```
When a preset or a kit is imported to a pattern, it becomes a copy of the preset/kit on the
+Drive and is not linked to the original preset/kit stored on the +Drive. Instead, it fully be-
comes a part of the pattern.
```
A pattern contains:

- A kit.
- Sequencer data such as trigs and parameter locks for the 16 tracks.
- The settings on the TRIG page, BPM, length, swing and time signature settings.

A kit contains:

- 16 audio or MIDI track presets.
- LEVEL settings for the audio tracks and the pattern.
- Compressor and Master distortion settings
- Compressor routing and Control all settings
- Send FX settings
- Track layering settings
- Patterns transpose settings

A preset contains:

- The SYN, FLTR, AMP, FX and MOD PARAMETER pages settings for the audio track. Or, in the case of
    MIDI presets, the SYN, FLTR, AMP, and MOD PARAMETER pages settings for the MIDI track.

### 9.1 THE +DRIVE LIBRARY AND THE POOL

The +Drive library can hold up to 2048 presets (256 presets in each bank A-H) that are available to all proj-
ects. The kits are also stored here.

Presets can be loaded to a pattern from either the +Drive library or the pool (Project RAM) of the active
project. The difference between the two is that the +Drive library has the capacity of 2048 presets, avail-
able to all projects, while the pool is a part of a projects internal memory and limited to 128 presets. The
primary benefit of presets loaded to the pool is the possibility for them to be preset locked. This feature is
not available for the presets in the +Drive library. For more information, please see “10.12.2 PRESET LOCKS”
on page 50.

track, any changes made will be stored as part of the active pattern.

Adjust the overall volume level of the active audio track with the LEVEL/DATA knob. This setting is saved as
part of the kit.

Edit a preset by adjusting the parameters found on the PARAMETER pages. Access these pages by
pressing a [PARAMETER] page key. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A-H to change the parameters. For more
information, please see “11. TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 57.

The complete preset, with all its parameter settings may be copied to another track. Press [TRK] + [TRIG
1–16] + [RECORD], and then press [TRK] + [TRIG 1–16] + [STOP] to paste the preset to the selected track.

### 9.5 SAVING A PRESET

After you edited the parameters of a preset, you can save it to the +Drive.

1. Press [PRESET/KIT] to open the PRESET/KIT menu.
2. Select PRESET > SAVE, and then press [YES].
3. Turn the LEVEL/DATA knob or use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to select an empty slot to where you want
    to save your preset, and then press [YES].
4. On the NAMING screen, name your preset and then press [YES]. For more information, please see
    “6.5 THE NAMING SCREEN” on page 19.
5. On the TAGS screen, use the [ARROW] keys and [YES] key to select the appropriate tags for your
    preset, and then select <SAVE> and press [YES].

### 9.6 THE SETUP MENU

Press [FUNC] + [FLTR] to open the SETUP menu. Here you can set a number of track and kit related pa-
rameters. Use the [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys to move between the options. Press [YES] to confirm your
selection. Press [NO] to exit the menu.

#### 9.6.1 KIT

```
Here you can select which tracks that should be affected by control all and set up the track routing to
the compressor.
```
```
CONTROL ALL CONFIG
Use the [TRIG] keys to select which tracks that you want to be affected by the control all functionality.
MIDI tracks can not be selected. For more information, please see “6.2.2 CONTROL ALL” on page
19.
```
- Control all operations also affects the active track, whether it is selected to be affect-
    ed or not.
- The control all functionality is not available for the MIDI tracks.


##### 9. PATTERNS, KITS AND PRESETS

##### COMPRESSOR ROUTING

```
Use the [TRIG] keys to select which tracks, inputs and effects that you want to be affected by the
compressor. MIDI tracks can not be selected. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] to navigate between the two
pages.
```
##### TRACK LAYERING

```
Track Layering makes it possible to trig two or more tracks with the same note from the sequencer or
the keyboard. For example, if you set track 1 to trigger track 2 then every note you play on track 1 also
plays on track 2, effectively playing two presets at the same time. However, the layering will not cas-
cade trigs. If track 3 is set to be triggered by track 2, and track 2 is set to be triggered by track 1, trigs
placed track 1 will not trigger track 3. Tracks that are layered to the active track have filled squares in
the parameter representation on the screen.
Use [FUNC] + [TRK] to select the active track, then use the [TRIG] keys to select which tracks that
will be layered to the active track.
```
##### PATTERN TRANSPOSE CONF

```
Use the [TRIG] keys to select/deselect which tracks that you want to be affected by pattern transpose.
```
##### TRACK SWAP

```
Use the [TRIG] keys to swap two tracks together with all settings, presets, and sequencer data and
make them change places with each other. Press and hold the two tracks [TRIG] keys untill the screen
reads “TRACKS X AND X SWAPPED”.
```

##### 9. PATTERNS, KITS AND PRESETS

#### 9.6.2 TRACK

Here you can set a number of track related parameters. Use [UP] and [DOWN] to move between the
options. Use [LEFT] and [RIGHT] to select settings or press [YES] to open sub-menus. Press [NO] to
exit the menu.

```
PLAY MODE
Here you can set if a preset is poly- or monophonic and if the LFOs for every voice are synced or not.
P O LY The Sound is polyphonic, and the LFOs for each voice are running independently of each
other.
POLY M.LFO In POLYPHONIC WITH MONO LFO mode, the preset is polyphonic, and the LFOs for
each voice are synced together with the first voice LFO. The LFO of the first voice played deter-
mines the cycle of the LFOs, and the subsequently played voices’ LFOs are synced to this cycle.
This makes the LFO behave like a single or monophonic LFO. This is useful, for example, if you want
to use the LFO for a tremolo effect.
MONO The preset is monophonic, and the envelope is always triggered by each note on/key press.
MONO LEG. In MONO LEGATO mode, the preset is monophonic, but the envelopes are not trig-
gered by a subsequent note on/key press if the first note is still held.
```
```
The number of voices used to play a preset is also affected by the LOCKED VOICES
setting in the VOICE MENU. For more information, please see “10.7 VOICE SETUP
MENU” on page 47.
```
```
MONO NOTE PRIO
Here you can set the note priority, i.e., what note is played if more than one note is played at the same
time. This setting is only available If PLAY MODE is set to MONO or MONO LEG.
LAST gives priority to the last note played.
LOW gives priority to the lowest note played.
HIGH gives priority to the highest note played.
```
```
VELOCITY TO VOL
Selects how MIDI velocity affects volume when playing the preset from a MIDI keyboard.
OFF means velocity does not affect the volume of the sound.
LOG applies a logarithmic velocity curve. The volume difference are greater between softer key-
board presses than between harder.
LIN applies a linear velocity curve. The volume difference between keyboard presses corresponds
linearly to the force applied.
EXP applies an exponential velocity curve. The volume difference are greater between harder
keyboard presses than between softer.
EXP 2 applies an exponential velocity curve. The volume difference are greater between harder
keyboard presses than between softer. The EXP 2 curve has a higher starting point, meaning that a
low velocity has a higher impact on the volume than on EXP.
```
```
OCTAVE
Sets the base octave of the preset. It also makes preset locking more practical since you can control
the octave setting on the preset and minimize the need to transpose the sequencer notes to make
two or more presets work together.
```
```
PITCH BEND DEPTH
Sets how much the pitch bend data from external MIDI devices affects the Digitone II.
```

##### 9. PATTERNS, KITS AND PRESETS

##### PORTAMENTO

```
Here you find settings related to the portamento. For more information, please see “11.3 TRIG PAGE 2”
on page 58.
TYPE
TRACK When you play notes, the pitch glides from the pitch of the last note played to the next
new note played on the track.
VOICE When you play notes, the pitch glides from the pitch of the last note played by a specific
voice to the pitch of the next new note played by the same voice.
LEGATO ONLY When playing notes, the pitch glides from the pitch of the last note played and
held (the key pressed down and not yet released) to the pitch of the next new note played on
the track.
SLOPE
CONSTANT RATE The pitch glides linearly at a constant rate. Longer glides take longer time to
complete.
CONSTANT TIME The pitch glides linearly, but the glide is completed in a specific time, regard-
less of the interval between the start and end notes. Glides over wider note intervals, therefore,
have a higher rate.
AMOUNT
This setting enables partial glides where just the final part of the interval is included in the glide. For
example, a setting of 100 gives a full glide from start to finish. Lower values start the glide closer to
the goal pitch.
STYLE
GLIDE Ordinary continuous portamento.
GLISSANDO Quantizes the portamento to semitones.
GATING
OFF The glide continues after the key is released.
ON The glide stops when the key is released.
```
```
KEY TRACKING
Opens a menu where you can assign up to four parameters to the key tracking. Both the NOTE
parameter on the TRIG menu and the key track information from incoming MIDI sent to the Digitone II
from external devices affects the assigned parameters. Press [YES] to open the menu.
You can select parameters from the SYN, FLTR, AMP, FX, and MOD PARAMETER pages. Turn the
DATA ENTRY knobs A–D to select the track parameters that you wish to assign. Press [YES] to con-
firm the selection. Then use DATA ENTRY knobs E–H to set the modulation depth of the four track
parameters. The depth is an offset of the original track parameter value.
Turn LEVEL/DATA to test your settings.
```
```
For key tracking, all modulation are centered around middle C (C5). A positive modula-
tion value increases the parameter value when playing above C5 and decreases when
you play a key below C5. A negative modulation value inverts this behavior.
For example: With a modulation value set to 8, each consecutive note changes the pa-
rameter value by 1. With a modulation value set to 127, each consecutive note changes
the parameter value by 16, meaning that you reach the full parameter rage in 8 notes
```

##### 9. PATTERNS, KITS AND PRESETS

## 10. THE SEQUENCER

10. THE SEQUENCER

The sequencer of the Digitone II stores information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the
tracks and various pattern-specific aspects of the tracks. Patterns are stored in projects. A project contains
8 banks (A to H) with 16 patterns each, which means 128 patterns are available for each project. For more
information, please see “13.3 PATTERN MENU” on page 73.

A pattern contains:

- General trig settings on the TRIG page (default note pitch, velocity et cetera).
- The kit with all parameter settings on the SYN, FLTR, AMP, FX and MOD pages.
- The settings on the DELAY, REVERB, CHORUS and MIXER pages.
- The settings in the SETUP menu.
- Quantization settings.
- Note trigs and Lock trigs for all tracks.
- Parameter/preset locks.
- Length and time signature for the tracks.

### 10.1 PATTERN OPERATIONS

Digitone II can seamlessly switch between patterns. This, together with the ability to chain patterns, is a
handy feature when improvising live. For more information, please see “10.1.3 CHAINS” on page 41.

#### 10.1.1 SELECTING BANK AND PATTERN

```
Press [PTN] and then use the [LEFT]/[RIGHT] keys to select a bank (if you want to select a pattern
from another bank than the current). Then press [TRIG 1–16] to select a pattern.
There is a secondary way to change bank and pattern, more similar to earlier Elektron devices. Press
[FUNC] + [PTN], and then press [TRIG 9–16] to select a bank. Then press [TRIG 1–16] to select a pat-
tern within that bank.
If you just want to select a pattern within the current bank, press [PTN] + [TRIG 1–16].
Press [PTN] or [NO] to exit bank/pattern selection.
White [TRIG] keys indicate pattern positions that contain data. A red [TRIG] key indicates the current
active pattern. Empty patterns are unlit.
When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern number will be shown flashing
in the upper left corner of the screen. Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will
start, and the pattern number will cease to flash.
```
- Patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running.
- Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages.
- It is possible to copy a pattern, and then paste it to one or several locations without
    leaving the active pattern. You can also clear one or several non-active patterns.
    - To copy, first press [PTN]. Then press [TRIG] + [RECORD] to select the pattern you
    wish to copy and copy it. Then press [TRIG] + [STOP] to select to where you want to
    paste the pattern and paste it.
    - To clear, first press [PTN]. Then press [TRIG] + [PLAY] to select the pattern you wish
    to clear and clear it.

#### 10.1.2 PATTERN CONTROL

```
Press [PLAY] to start the playback of a pattern. Press [STOP] to stop the playback of all tracks. The
sound will be cut off, but effects like Delay will continue to be audible until the delay repeats have faded
out. Quickly press [STOP] + [STOP] to stop playback of all tracks and get just a short fade out of the
send effects.
When a pattern is playing, press [PLAY] to pause the playback. Press [PLAY] to resume the playback.
If a pattern contains more than 16 sequencer steps, the <PATTERN PAGE> LEDs will indicate this. When
a pattern is playing, the currently active pattern page is shown with a flashing, <PATTERN PAGE> LED.
```
#### 10.1.3 CHAINS

```
Chains are sequences that consist of more than one pattern. You can use chains to preselect and auto-
mate the order in which you want your patterns to play
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
You can create one chain and it can contain any pattern in bank A–H. The chain can consist of up to 64
patterns.
```
1. Press [PTN], and then press [FUNC] + [YES] to open the chain creator screen.
2. Use the [LEFT]/[RIGHT] keys to select a bank (if you want to select a pattern from another bank
    than the current). Then press [TRIG 1–16] to select a pattern. Repeat until you have created the
    desired chain.
3. (Optional) Press [FUNC] + [LEFT] to delete the last pattern from the chain.
4. Press [YES] to confirm the pattern chain and close the chain creator screen. Press [NO] if you
    wish to cancel the pattern chain and close the chain creator screen.
5. Press [PLAY] to start the sequencer and play the chain. The chain will be looped once the final
    pattern of the chain has played.
To exit chain mode, select a pattern or song using the normal selection process.
There is also a legacy procedure for creating chains.
1. Press and hold [PTN] and then press a [TRIG 1–16] key to select the first pattern in the chain.
2. Release the [PTN] key and then press [TRIG 1–16] keys in the same order as you want the chained
patterns to play. Keep a previous [TRIG] key pressed while you press the next one, the one after
that and so on. You can press the same [TRIG] key again if you wish to add the pattern multiple
times in a row. If you want to add a pattern from another bank, use the [LEFT]/[RIGHT] keys to
select a bank and then press [TRIG 1–16] to select pattern.
3. Press [PLAY] to start the sequencer and play the chain. The chain will be looped once the final
pattern of the chain has played.

```
Please note that the chain will be lost when you create a new chain or when you select a new
pattern/song. Chains cannot be saved and will be lost when you switch the Digitone II off.
```
- Chains can be created while the sequencer is running.
- You can also use MIDI program change messages from an external device to change
    patterns on the Digitone II. For more information, please see “13.4.1 SYNC” on page 74.

### 10.2 EDITING A PATTERN

```
Digitone II offers several modes of input when creating or editing a pattern. Three of them are, GRID RE-
CORDING mode, LIVE RECORDING mode, and STEP RECORDING mode. In these modes, two types of
trigs can be entered: Note trigs and Lock trigs.
```
#### 10.2.1 TRIG TYPES

```
A trig is a sequencer event that you can place when you want the sequencer to perform an action on the
Digitone II. There are two types of trigs that you can use, note trigs and lock trigs.
```
- NOTE TRIGS trigger preset notes or MIDI notes.
- LOCK TRIGS trigger parameter locks (but do not trigger notes). For more information, please see
    “10.12.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 50.
Note trigs are indicated by red [TRIG] keys and lock trigs are indicated by yellow [TRIG] keys. Unlit
[TRIG] keys indicate steps that does not contain any trigs. Read more about parameter locks in section
“10.12.1 PARAMETER LOCKS” on page 50. Trigs are added differently in the sequencer, depending on
whether GRID RECORDING, LIVE RECORDING, or STEP RECORDING mode is active. Note trigs can
also be added in NOTE EDIT mode.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

### 10.3 GRID RECORDING MODE

GRID RECORDING is a method of composing where you use the [TRIG] keys to add trigs.

1. Press [RECORD] to enter GRID RECORDING mode. The [RECORD] key lights up red to indicate that
    GRID RECORDING mode is active.
2. Select the track to which you want to add trigs by pressing and holding [TRACK] and then one of the
    [TRIG] keys. A red [TRIG] key indicates the active track.
3. Place note trigs on the sequencer using the sixteen [TRIG] keys. To add a lock trig, press [FUNC] +
    [TRIG]. Quickly pressing the [TRIG] key of any of the trigs entered will remove the trig. Pressing a
    [TRIG] key and holding it slightly longer will prepare the trig for editing, rather than removing it.
4. Select another track, and add note trigs. Repeat the procedure for all the tracks you want to use.
5. Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence.

You can transpose a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key, and then press [+]/[-].

Add micro timing to a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key, and then press [LEFT]/[RIGHT].
For more information, please see “10.8 MICRO TIMING” on page 48.

Set the retrig speed by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while navigating to TRIG PAGE 2 keys and
make the desired settings. For more information, please see “10.9 RETRIGS” on page 48, and “11.3 TRIG
PAGE 2” on page 58.

If the pattern contains more than 16 steps, select the pattern page you want to edit by pressing the [PAGE]
key. A fully lit <PATTERN PAGE> LED shows the active pattern page.

Press [RECORD] to exit the GRID RECORDING mode.

- If your pattern has more than one page you can easily select which page you want to
    edit. Press and hold [PAGE], and then press one of the [TRIG 1–8] keys that light up to
    select the active page for editing. You can also cycle through the pages with the [LEFT]
    and [RIGHT] keys while holding [PAGE]. For more information, please see “10.11 PAGE
    SETUP MENU” on page 48.
- You also have the possibility to select which pages of your pattern you want the se-
    quencer to play and loop. The selected pages are then looped on playback.
    In GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold [PAGE], and then press [TRIG 9–16] to
    select which pattern pages you want to play and loop. Green [TRIG] keys shows the
    selected pages. The [TRIG 9–16] keys corresponds to pattern page 1–8. For example,
    you have an eight page pattern and you want to play and loop page 1, 2,5, and 7. To ac-
    complish this, press and hold [PAGE] and then press [TRIG 9, 10, 13, 15]. On the top row,
    [TRIG 1–8], the blinking [TRIG] key shows the master playback position. On the bottom
    row, [TRIG 9–16], the blinking [TRIG] key shows the page currently playing. Press and
    hold [PAGE] and then press [NO] to resume normal playback of all pages in the pattern.
- You can use an external MIDI controller such as a keyboard to input NOTE and TRIG
    VELOCITY data when you are in GRID RECORDING mode. Just press and hold a [TRIG]
    key, and then play a note on the external keyboard. The first note sets the TRIG VELOC-
    ITY value for all notes on the trig.
- Press [TRIG] + [YES] to preview a specific trig. The preview includes any parameter
    locks you have placed on that trig.
- Press [TRIG] + [PRESET/KIT] to save the sound of a trig as a preset, taking all parame-
    ter locks into consideration.
- If you use an external MIDI controller to record to the Digitone II MIDI tracks, the se-
    quencer receives data on the Auto MIDI channel and records on the active track. For
    more information, please see “13.4.3 CHANNELS” on page 76.
- All trigs of a track can be shifted forwards or backward on the sequencer. While in GRID
    RECORDING mode, hold down [FUNC] while pressing the [LEFT]/[RIGHT].

#### 10.3.1 NOTE EDIT MENU

```
The NOTE EDIT menu is part of the GRID RECORDING mode and gives you the possibility to separately
edit each note of a step, even if they are part of a polyphonic chord. You can edit four different param-
eters. NOTE, LEN, and VEL are the same parameters that can be found on the TRIG PAGE 1. For more
information, please see “11.2 TRIG PAGE 1” on page 57. The fourth parameter, TIME lets you adjust
the timing of each note. You can also use the NOTE EDIT menu to add new notes. At the top of the menu
you can see which step your are currently editing, written in the format Page:Step. LEVEL/DATA sets the
keyboard MODE. For more information, please see “8.5.2 KEYBOARD SETUP MENU” on page 25.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

##### EDITING NOTES ON ALREADY PLACED TRIGS

```
In GRID RECORDING mode, press the placed [TRIG] + [NOTE EDIT] to open the NOTE EDIT menu. Use
[UP]/[DOWN] to highlight the note you want to edit. Then use DATA ENTRY knobs E–H to change the
parameters. Hold [FUNC] and then turn DATA ENTRY knobs E–H to change the parameters to affect all
notes on that step.
NOTE Sets the note value for the selected note. The selectable notes are limited to the ones existing
in the scale selected in the KEYBOARD SETUP menu if NOTE PARAM is set to SCALE in the PER-
SONALIZE menu. For more information, please see “8.5.2 KEYBOARD SETUP MENU” on page 25.
Press and turn DATA ENTRY knob A to select any note in the Chromatic scale.
TIME Sets the micro timing for the selected note. A positive value moves the note later. A negative
value moves the note earlier. For example, a value of 12 moves the note halfway towards the next trig.
A value of -6 moves the note a quarter of the way towards the previous trig. The full range is -23–23.
LEN Sets the note length for the selected note.
VEL Sets the velocity for the selected note.
```
```
Use the following shortcuts and procedures for further editing.
```
- [FUNC] + [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to go to the previous/next sequencer step that contains a note trig.
- [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to go the previous/next sequencer step regardless if it contains a trig or not.
- [FUNC] + [UP] to delete the highlighted note.
- [FUNC] + [DOWN] to add a note below the highlighted note.
- [FUNC] + [YES] to preview the selected step. The preview only takes the NOTE and VEL settings
    into account. The TIME and LEN settings can not be previewed.
- Press DATA ENTRY knob E to sort the notes to sort the note list per pitch. The highest on top, the
    lowest on bottom. This sorting option is shown by a downward pointing arrow next to the NOTE
    parameter. Press DATA ENTRY knob F to sort the notes to sort the note list per time. The earliest
    on top, the latest on bottom. This sorting option is shown by a downward pointing arrow next to the
    TIME parameter.
- You can also move rows that has the same microtiming. Highlight the row you want to move and
    then press [YES] to select it. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to move the row to the desired position, and then
    press [YES] to place it.

```
ADDING AND EDITING NOTES USING NOTE EDIT

work like in KEYBOARD mode. You can also select which step to edit manually by pressing [FUNC] +
[TRIG] key. Press [FUNC] + [PAGE] to navigate to the next pattern page.
```
```
You can also use an external MIDI keyboard to add notes in the NOTE EDIT menu.
```
1. Connect an external MIDI controller to the Digitone II.
2. Set the controllers MIDI channel to the same channel as Digitone II's AUTO CHANNEL
3. Press [NOTE], and then select the active step that you wish to record on..
4. Press [REC], and then press the keys on the MIDI controller
The note values, the length, and the velocity are then recorded om the active step.

### 10.4 LIVE RECORDING MODE

```
LIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the
[TRIG] keys are played in real time to input trigs to the tracks. You can also use KEYBOARD mode to add
note trigs chromatically. Additionally you can add velocity, retrigs, and change presets using the TRIG
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

modes. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real time. Trigs input in LIVE RECORDING mode can
be automatically quantized or not. Non-quantized trigs can be quantized after they are recorded, by using
the QUANTIZE menu that is accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [TRIG]. For more information, please see
“10.10 QUANTIZE MENU” on page 48.

1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. (Press [PLAY] twice
    while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed to activate/deactivate automatic quantization.) The se-
    quencer starts to play, and the [RECORD] key starts to flash red.
2. Enter trigs in real time by pressing the [TRIG] keys. If KEYBOARD mode is active, the pitch value
    of the note trig will be recorded according to which [TRIG] key is pressed for the active track. Any
    changes to PARAMETER page settings, using the DATA ENTRY knobs, will be recorded as parameter
    locks and add lock trigs where needed.
3. Press [PLAY] to exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing. If LIVE RECORD-
    ING mode is active and [RECORD] is pressed, GRID RECORDING mode will be activated.
4. Press [STOP] to stop both recording and playback of the sequencer.

```
You can use an external MIDI controller such as a keyboard to input NOTE, TRIG
VELOCITY, and TRIG LENGTH data in LIVE RECORDING mode. Just play the notes on
the external keyboard and they will be recorded by the sequencer. The first note sets the
TRIG VELOCITY value for all notes on the trig. The last note that is released sets the TRIG
LENGTH for all notes on the trig.
```
### 10.5 STEP RECORDING MODE

STEP RECORDING is a quick and straightforward method of placing trigs on the sequencer. In this record-
ing mode, you insert notes by pressing the [TRIG] keys or by using an external MIDI controller. The se-
quencer then captures the note and automatically advances to the next step. There are two different modes
available, STANDARD mode and JUMP mode.

```
STANDARD mode
```
1. Press [RECORD] + [STOP] to enter STEP RECORDING mode. The [RECORD] key starts to
    double-blink red. (Press [STOP] twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed to toggle between
    STANDARD and JUMP mode).
2. Press a [TRIG] key to select the active step to where you want to start to add note trigs. The active
    step is shown with a green [TRIG] key that double-blinks. (If positioned on an earlier placed trig, it
    inherits the light pattern of that trig). You can also use [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to select the active step or
    skip steps.
3. Press and hold [FUNC] and then press [TRIG 1–16] key to add a note trig on the corresponding
    track to the active step. The active step then automatically advances to the next step.
    You also have the option to add note trigs chromatically on the selected active track.
4. Press [TRK] + [TRIG 1–16] to select the track to which you want to add trigs. A red [TRIG] key
    indicates the active track.
5. Press and hold [KEYBOARD] and then press any lit [TRIG] key to add a note trig with the corre-
    sponding note value to the selected step. The active step then automatically advances to the next
    step. You can use [+]/[-] or [UP]/[DOWN] to transpose the chromatic keyboard on the [TRIG] keys
    up or down in octaves. The settings made in the KEYBOARD SETUP menu affects which notes are
    added by pressing the [TRIG] keys. For more information, please see “8.5.2 KEYBOARD SETUP
    MENU” on page 25.
6. To remove a trig or to add a rest (no trig), position the active step on the trig that you want to
    remove or add a rest to, and then press [NO]. The active step then automatically advances to the
    next step.
7. To add a parameter lock to a trig, press and hold a [TRIG] key, and then turn the DATA ENTRY
    knob that controls the parameter you want to lock and set it to the desired value. The graphics
    become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter value is displayed. The [TRIG]
    key of the locked trig blinks red (for note trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to indicate that the trig now
    contains a parameter lock.
8. Press [RECORD] to exit STEP RECORDING mode.

```
JUMP mode
In JUMP mode, the LEN parameter setting on the TRIG PARAMETER page controls the note length of
the trigs you place, and advances the active step the same length. A LEN value of 1/16 adds a sixteenth
note and advances the sequencer one step. 1/8 adds an eighth note and advances the sequencer two
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
steps. 1/4 adds a quarter note and advances the sequencer four steps and so on. The LEN parameter is
also parameter locked on every trig you place.
```
- Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence while you are programming it. Press [STOP] to
    stop the sequencer and stay in STEP RECORDING mode.
- If you are in PRESET POOL TRIG mode, you must press and hold [FUNC] and then
    press the [TRIG] keys to be able to add trigs in STEP RECORDING mode. For more
    information, please see “8.5.4 TRIG MODE” on page 27.
- If you use an external MIDI controller, you must set it to send MIDI data on the Digitone
    II’s defined AUTO CHANNEL. For more information, please see “13.4.3 CHANNELS” on
    page 76.
- If you use an external MIDI controller, the trig’s VEL (velocity) value is determined by the
    velocity sent from these and is parameter locked.
- If you press and hold [FUNC] while inputting notes from an external MIDI controller, the
    velocity is fixed and determined by the VEL parameter setting.
- If you press and hold [YES] while you place a trig with [TRIG] keys or an external MIDI
    controller, the trig length is locked to the time you press the [TRIG] keys or the external
    MIDI controller.
- If you add a new note trig on a previously placed note trig, any parameter locks previ-
    ously placed on that trig remain as they were.
- In STEP RECORDING mode, to avoid accidental key presses, [FUNC] + [NO] does not
    reload the pattern. [FUNC] + [YES] does not save the pattern. Instead they work as
    described above.

### 10.6 SEQUENCER MENU (EUCLIDEAN MODE)

```
The Euclidean sequencer mode uses two separate pulse generators to generate events (trigs) that are
placed as evenly spread out over the sequencer track’s trigs as possible. You can also set a Boolean logic
operator to combine or subtract the trigs from the two pulse generators in different ways.
When you turn on Euclidean mode for a track, the [REC] button will turn blue indicating the mode is active,
and the [TRIG] keys where the generated trigs are placed will also be blue. Any trigs placed on the se-
quencer before activating the Euclidean mode will be hidden and inactive while in this mode, but they’ll
reappear when you turn the mode off again. If you want to convert an Euclidean sequence into regular
sequencer trigs, just press and hold [FUNC] while turning the Euclidean mode off. This will remove any trigs
that were placed prior to entering Euclidean mode.. While in Euclidean mode, it is not possible to add note
trigs manually to the sequencer. However, you can still do parameter locking on the already generated trigs.
Press [FUNC] + [AMP] open the SEQUENCER menu.
```
```
PL1 Pulse generator 1 sets the number of pulses (trigs) placed on the sequencer by this generator.
PL2 Pulse generator 2 sets the number of pulses (trigs) placed on the sequencer by this generator.
LEN Track length sets how many steps the track will have. This parameter is only available in PER
TRACK mode. For more information, please see “10.11 PAGE SETUP MENU” on page 48.
EUC Euclidean mode switches the Euclidean sequencer mode on/off.
R01 Rotation generator 1 rotates the trigs placed by generator 1 forward or backwards on the track.
R02 Rotation generator 2 rotates the trigs placed by generator 2 forward or backwards on the track.
TRO Track rotation rotates the trigs placed by both generator 1 and generator 2 forward or backwards
on the track.
OP Boolean operator lets you add or subtract the trigs generated from the two pulse generators in dif-
ferent ways based on mathematical logical expressions.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
OR All trigs from both generator 1 or 2 are placed on the track.
XOR Trigs from both generator 1 or 2 are placed on the track unless they are added to the same
sequencer step.
AND Only trigs added to the same sequencer step by generator 1 and 2 are placed on the track.
SUB Trigs from generator 1 are placed on the track unless generator 2 adds a trig on the same step
as generator 1.
```
```
In Euclidean mode, please note that if you press any already generated trigs, they will remain
in regular sequencer mode when you switch Euclidean mode off.
```
### 10.7 VOICE SETUP MENU

Press [VOICE SETUP] to open the VOICE SETUP menu, where you handle the allocation of the Digitone II’s
16 voices. In this menu, you can also make the settings for unison and voice stealing. Press [TRK] + [TRIG
1–16] to select which track to edit. At the top of the screen, you can see what track is selected. The center
of the screen shows the currently playing voices. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to change the settings. Press
[NO] to exit the menu. The voice settings are stored in the active pattern.

```
VOICE STEAL The Digitone II has 16 voice polyphony. VOICE STEAL sets the rules for how voices are
stolen (which voice is taken when you play a new note) when you use more than 16 voices at the same
time. The VOICE STEAL parameter affects the whole pattern.
CYCLE The first played note is stolen first.
TRACK Track priority. Notes played on track 1 has priority over notes played on track 2–16. Track 2
notes over track 3–16. Track 3 notes over track 4–16 etc.
LO Lowest note is stolen first
HI Highest note is stolen first.
REUSE Sets if the same note played twice should reuse the same voice, or cycle to use another free
voice.
ON Reuses the same voice. Useful for staccato effects and drums.
OFF Cycles to use another voice. Good for piano-like sounds and pads.
VOICES Sets the number of voices (1–16) you want to lock to a specific track. A locked voice cannot be
used or stolen by another track. If you lock voices to a track, the track cannot use more voices than the
ones that are locked to it. The first number shows the number of locked voices to the track. The number
in brackets shows how many unlocked voices that remain. If you set the parameter to DYN (dynamic) it
will use any available voices to play its preset.
```
```
The number of voices that are used to play a preset is also affected by the PLAY MODE
setting in the SETUP menu. For more information, please see “9.6 THE SETUP MENU” on
page 35.
```
```
STAT E Unison State turn unison on/off. Unison gives the possibility to add several voices to play the
same note.
V.AMNT Unison Voice Amount sets the number of voices that plays for each note.
```
```
[FUNC] + [VOICE SETUP] toggles unison on/off.
```
```
SPREAD Unison Spread adds pan and detune to the unison voices.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
You can copy the settings in the VOICE menu and paste it to another pattern. In the VOICE
menu, press [FUNC] + [RECORD] to copy the parameter settings. Change pattern and open
VOICE menu, and then press [FUNC] + [STOP] to paste the settings.
```
### 10.8 MICRO TIMING

```
Here you can add micro timing to a note trig, moving it ahead or behind the beat. Micro timing can be
customized on any of the sequencer steps on both audio and MIDI tracks. In GRID RECORDING mode,
press and hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then press [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to access the pop-up Micro
timing menu that shows the time offset for the chosen sequencer step(s) on the active track. Press [LEFT]/
[RIGHT] to adjust the time offset. To exit the MICRO TIMING menu, release the [TRIG] key(s). The micro
timing settings are stored in the active pattern.
```
### 10.9 RETRIGS

```
Retrigs can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on the audio tracks (the retrig function is not
available on the MIDI tracks). In GRID RECORDING mode, press [TRIG PARAMETERS] twice to access the
RETRIG PARAMETERS page. Hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then set the desired retrig options for
the trig(s).
For more information about the parameters on this page, please see “11.3 TRIG PAGE 2” on page 58.
```
### 10.10 QUANTIZE MENU

```
The quantization affects all micro timed and off grid trigs on the sequencers tracks. Press [FUNC] +
[TRIG PARAMETERS] to access this menu. Change settings with DATA ENTRY knob E and H.
```
```
TRACK affects all the trigs of the active track in real time. The higher the quantize value, the more the
trigs will be quantized. Press [TRIG 1–16] key to select track to quantize.
PATTERN affects all the trigs of all tracks in the pattern in real time. The higher the quantize value, the
more the trigs will be quantized.
Press [NO] to exit the menu.
```
### 10.11 PAGE SETUP MENU

```
You can set the length and timing of the pattern and the tracks in this menu. The sequencer has up to 128
steps spread over 8 pages with 16 steps each. The PAGE SETUP menu has two modes. In PER PATTERN
mode all tracks share the same length. In PER TRACK mode, each track can have different lengths. Press
[FUNC] + [PAGE] to access the PAGE SETUP menu. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to toggle between the two
modes. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to adjust the settings.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

#### 10.11.1 PER PATTERN MODE

In this mode, all tracks of the pattern share the same length and time signature.

```
LENGTH sets the amount of steps on the current pattern page. The leftmost number displays the
number of steps selected. If you use 17 steps or more in a pattern, the [PAGE] key is (while in GRID
RECORDING mode) used to toggle between the different pattern pages.
SPEED controls the speed of pattern playback in multiples of the current tempo. It offers seven pos-
sible settings, 1/8X, 1/4X, 1/2X, 3/4X, 1X, 3/2X and 2X. A setting of 1/8X plays back the pattern at one-
eighth of the set tempo. 3/4X plays the pattern back at three-quarters of the tempo; 3/2X plays back
the pattern twice as fast as the 3/4X setting. 2X makes the pattern play at twice the BPM.
```
When you extend the length of a pattern, its trigs copies automatically over to the new steps. (If this
option is selected in SETTINGS > PERSONALIZE > AUTO COPY) If a pattern consists of for example
two pages and the pattern length is increased to four pages, the two additional pattern pages are then
copies of the first two pattern pages.

Press the [PAGE] key repeatedly to change the total length of the pattern quickly. Press the [TRIG] keys
to change the number of steps of the pattern quickly.

```
A 2X speed setting is useful for increasing the base resolution of the step sequencer to
32nd notes. A 3/4X setting is useful when Digitone II is playing alongside other instru-
ments set to the same BPM, and you want Digitone II to play triplets.
```
#### 10.11.2 PER TRACK MODE

In this mode, you can assign individual length and speed to the tracks of the pattern. Press [FUNC] + [YES]
to switch between the two modes. In PER TRACK mode, you find two sections, TRACK and PATTERN.

The TRACK column sets the step length and speed of the track. The settings only affects the active track.

The PATTERN column sets the master change length and the master length of the pattern.

```
LENGTH sets the amount of steps on the current pattern page. The leftmost number displays the
number of steps on the active pattern page. If you use 17 steps or more in a pattern, the [PAGE] key is
(while in GRID RECORDING mode) used to toggle between the different pattern pages.
SPEED controls the speed of track playback in multiples of the current tempo. It offers seven possible
settings, 1/8X, 1/4X, 1/2X, 3/4X, 1X, 3/2X and 2X. A setting of 1/8X plays back the track at one-eighth
of the set tempo. 3/4X plays the track back at three-quarters of the tempo; 3/2X plays back the track
twice as fast as the 3/4X setting. 2X makes the track play at twice the BPM.
CHANGE (Pattern Change) controls for how long the active pattern plays before it changes to a cued
or chained pattern. This setting is important when, for example, you set RESET to INF. Then, if you do
not make any CHANGE setting, the pattern plays infinitely and the next cued pattern will never play. By
default a cued pattern change happens at the end of the pattern (CHANGE set to OFF).
RESET (Pattern Reset) controls the number of steps the pattern plays before all tracks resets and re-
starts from the first step on the first page. An INF setting makes the tracks of the pattern loop infinite-
ly, without ever being restarted. Note that this setting also affects for how long the active pattern plays
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
before a chained pattern starts playing. The CHANGE parameter overrides this if its parameter value
is less than the RESET value.
```
```
In the PAGE SETUP menu, you can press [FUNC] + [UP]/[DOWN] to set the TRACK
LENGTH in increments from 2/16 to 128/128.
```
### 10.12 SEQUENCER FEATURES

#### 10.12.1 PARAMETER LOCKS.

```
Parameter locks makes it possible to set every trig to have its own unique parameter values. The note
trigs of an audio track can, for example, have different pitch, amp or filter settings. It is possible to pa-
rameter lock the parameters found on the PARAMETER pages, and you can apply parameter locks to
all types of tracks. For a complete overview of all parameters on the PARAMETER pages, please see “11.
TRACK PARAMETERS” on page 57, and “APPENDIX A: MACHINES” on page 89.
Adding parameter locks in GRID RECORDING mode.
```
1. Press [RECORD] to enter GRID RECORDING mode.
2. Press a [TRIG] key to add a Note trig or [FUNC] + [TRIG] key to add a Lock trig where you want to
    perform a parameter lock.
3. Press and hold the [TRIG] key of a previously placed trig (note trig or a lock trig).
4. Turn the DATA ENTRY knobs that control the parameter you want to lock, and set it to the desired
    value. The graphics become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter value is
    displayed. The [TRIG] key of the locked trig blinks red (for note trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to
    indicate the trig now contains a parameter lock.
Remove a single parameter lock by holding [TRIG] + pressing the DATA ENTRY knob of the locked pa-
rameter. You can erase all parameter locks from a trig if you remove the note trig and then enter it again.
Adding parameter locks in LIVE RECORDING mode.
1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode.
2. Turn a DATA ENTRY knob, or play the [TRIG] keys in KEYBOARD mode, to add parameter locks to
the active track. Note trigs are placed, and parameter locked accordingly, and it also places lock
trigs that contains the parameter locks on the sequencer steps that do not already have any trigs.
Press [NO] + one (or several) of the [TRIG] keys to erase a sequence of recorded trigs on a specific
track (or on several tracks) in time with the sequencer, i.e. all held trigs reached by the pattern’s playhead
will be erased.
You can also remove specific parameter locks on a track in real time. In LIVE RECORDING mode, press
and hold [NO] and then press and hold the DATA ENTRY knob corresponding to the parameter that you
want to remove.
Adding parameter locks in STEP RECORDING mode.
1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [STOP] to enter STEP RECORDING mode.
2. Press and hold a [TRIG] key, and then turn the DATA ENTRY knobs that control the parameter you
want to lock, and set it to the desired value. The graphics become inverted for the locked parame-
ter, and the locked parameter value is displayed. The [TRIG] key of a locked trig blinks red (for note
trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to indicate that the trig contains a parameter lock.
- Up to 80 different parameters can be locked in a pattern. A parameter counts as one (1)
locked parameter no matter how many trigs that lock it. If for example the cutoff param-
eter of the filter is locked on every sequencer step, there are still 79 other parameters
that can be locked.
- In GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold a trig that contains parameter locks, the
[PARAMETER] page keys lights up in red to show the location of the locked parameters.
- You can add a parameter lock to all the existing trigs on a page by pressing and holding
[TRIG] + [PAGE] or [TRK], and then turn a DATA ENTRY knob.

#### 10.12.2 PRESET LOCKS

```
You can change a track's preset to another preset from the pool on any individual sequencer step. These
preset locks are an immensely useful feature for adding variations to a track. Press and hold a note trig
and turn the LEVEL/DATA knob to open the pool list. Use the LEVEL/DATA knob to scroll through the
list. Select the preset you want to assign to the note trig and then release the [TRIG] key. Press and hold
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

the [TRIG] key of the note trig to show the assigned preset. For more information, please see “9.1.1 ADD-
ING PRESETS TO THE POOL” on page 29, and “9.2.1 LOAD (PRESET)” on page 30.

#### 10.12.3 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS

Trig conditions are a set of conditional rules that you can apply to any trig, using specific parameter locks
called conditional locks. Each rule is a logical condition that determines whether a trig set on a track in
the sequencer is triggered or not. If the condition is true, then the trig will play. If the condition is false,
the trig will not play.

```
ADDING A CONDITIONAL LOCK
```
1. In GRID RECORDING or STEP RECORDING mode, place a note trig or lock trig on the sequencer
    step to where you want to apply a conditional lock.
2. Press and hold the trig to access the COND (Trig Condition) parameter on the TRIG PAGE 1. For
    more information, please see “11.2 TRIG PAGE 1” on page 57.
3. Turn DATA ENTRY knob H to select one of the following trig conditions:
PRE is true and the trig plays if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the same track was true.
(PRE and PRE conditions are not evaluated and are ignored).
PRE (Not PRE) is true when PRE is false. A trig with this trig condition plays if the most recently
evaluated trig condition on the same track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions are ignored and not
evaluated.)
Example 1: Trig 1, 50% = True > Trig 2, PRE = False > Trig 3, PRE = False > Trig 4, PRE = True
Example 2: Trig 1, 50% = False > Trig 2, PRE = True > Trig 3, PRE = True > Trig 4, PRE = False
NEI is true and the trig plays if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the neighbor track was
true. (PRE and PRE conditions on the neighbor track are not evaluated and are ignored) The neighbor
track is the track before the active track. For example, track 3 is the neighbor track of track 4. NEI
and NEI conditional trigs on track 4 therefore evaluate the conditional trigs placed on track 3. The NEI
condition is false if no conditional trigs exist on the neighbor track.
NEI (Not NEI) is true when NEI is false. A trig with this trig condition plays if the most recently evaluat-
ed trig condition on the neighbor track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions on the neighbor track
are ignored and not evaluated.)
1ST The trig plays only on the first loop of the pattern.
1ST (Not 1ST) The trig does not play on the first loop of the pattern.
LST The trig plays the last time the pattern plays before changing to another pattern.
LST (Not LST) The trig does not play the last time the pattern plays before changing to another pattern.
A:B A sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length is shorter than the pattern length)
plays before the trig condition is true. B sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length
is shorter than the pattern length) plays before the count is reset and starts over again. This cycle
then repeats until you stop the sequencer.
For example:
With the setting 1:2, the trig plays the first time the pattern plays and then the third, the fifth, and so on.
With the setting 2:2, the trig plays the second time the pattern plays and then the fourth, the sixth, and
so on.
With the setting 2:4, the trig plays the second time the pattern plays and then the sixth, the tenth, and
so on.
With the setting 4:7 the trig plays the fourth time the pattern plays and then the eleventh, the eigh-
teenth, and so on.
A:B (Not A:B) is true when A:B is false. Meaning a trig with this condition plays when the set condition
of pattern plays are not met.
For example:
With the setting 2:4, the trig does not play the second time the pattern plays and then not on the sixth,
the tenth, and so on.

```
Conditional parameter locks are a great way to add variety to a pattern. To set up a grid
of mutually exclusive or conclusive note trigs across any of the tracks, and adding some
probability locks in there as well (perhaps, in turn, also sporting an array of logically con-
ditioned trigs), is a neat way to make the most minimal of compositions come alive with
randomness.
```

##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

- The FILL trig condition has a separate parameter on TRIG PAGE 1. For more informa-
    tion, please see “11.2 TRIG PAGE 1” on page 57.
- The sequencer needs to be in FILL mode to activate the conditional lock called FILL.
    For more information, please see “10.12.4 FILL MODE” on page 52.
- FILL trig conditions may also be used, for example, to have two different melodic or per-
    cussive sequences on the same track, one of which is activated only when FILL mode is
    active.

#### 10.12.4 FILL MODE

```
FILL mode can be used to create a temporary variation, such as a drum fill, in your pattern.
Press [YES] + [PAGE] to activate FILL mode for one pattern cycle. It will become active when the
pattern loops, and remain active until it loops again. You can also activate FILL mode at any time, and
for any duration, by pressing and holding the [PAGE] key when the pattern is playing (when not in GRID
RECORDING mode). The FILL mode is active for as long as the key is held.
Press and hold [PAGE] + [YES], and then release [PAGE] before you release [YES] to latch FILL mode.
Press [PAGE] again to unlatch FILL mode.
```
#### 10.12.5 COPY, PASTE AND CLEAR OPERATIONS

```
Patterns, tracks, track pages, parameter pages, and trigs can be copied, pasted and cleared.
The active pattern can be copied to another location in the same bank or in another bank. To perform
a pattern copy operation, GRID RECORDING mode must be deactivated. Copy the pattern by pressing
[FUNC] + [RECORD]. Select another pattern, and then press [FUNC] + [STOP] to paste the copied
pattern to this location. Press [FUNC] + [PLAY] to clear all the trigs in the current pattern.
Individual sequencer tracks can be copied, pasted and cleared in the same way as patterns. To do so,
GRID RECORDING mode must be active.
A single track page may also be copied, pasted and cleared. It is similar to copying/pasting/clearing a
track, but will only affect the active track page. Select the track page of choice by pressing the [PAGE]
key. Copy by pressing [PAGE] + [RECORD]. Select a new track page and press [PAGE] + [STOP] to
paste. Press [PAGE] + [PLAY] to clear the active track page.
A single parameter page with all it's settings may also be copied, pasted and cleared. Select the pa-
rameter page you wish to copy by pressing a [PARAMETER] key. Copy by pressing [PARAMETER] +
[RECORD]. Select a new track and then press the same [PARAMETER] page + [STOP] to paste. Press
[PARAMETER] + [PLAY] to clear the parameter page.
Trigs, complete with all parameter lock settings, can be copied, pasted and cleared as well. GRID
RECORDING mode needs to be active to access this functionality. Press and hold a trig and press
[RECORD] to perform the copy operation. Paste by holding another [TRIG] key and pressing [STOP].
It is also possible to copy more than one trig. Press and hold the trigs you wish to copy, and then press
[RECORD]. Press and hold the [TRIG] key to where you want to paste, and then press [STOP] to paste
the copied sequence of trigs. When pasting, the copied trigs are placed in the same relation to each
other as they had when they were copied. The destination trig acts as the starting point for the sequence
of copied trigs. Clear trig locks by holding one or more trigs and press [PLAY].
You can undo any copy, paste, and clear operation by repeating the key presses.
```
```
Without leaving the active pattern, you can copy a pattern, paste it into one or several slots,
and also clear one or several patterns. First, press [PTN], then press [TRIG] + [RECORD]
to select the pattern you wish to copy and copy it. Then press [TRIG] + [STOP] to paste
the copied pattern where you want. Press [TRIG] + [PLAY] to clear the selected pattern.
```
#### 10.12.6 TEMPORARY SAVE AND RELOAD PATTERN COMMANDS

```
Patterns can instantly be saved to a temporary memory space and then reloaded again from this space.
```
- Press [FUNC] + [YES] to perform a temporary save of the active pattern. This is useful in order to cre-
    ate a restore point when you are live tweaking, but without permanently save your changes.
- Press [FUNC] + [NO] to reload a pattern that was previously temporarily saved. It will reload the pat-
    tern from when you last used the temporary save command. If you have not done any temporary save,
    then the pattern will reload from the permanently saved state.


##### 10. THE SEQUENCER

```
The TEMPORARY SAVE PATTERN and TEMPORARY RELOAD PATTERN commands are
great when improvising live. Any changes made to the active pattern, like adding bass line
notes or using CONTROL ALL, can immediately be undone. And at the same time, the
saves and reloads will not affect the pattern in a permanent way.
```
```
The TEMPORARY SAVE PATTERN command will not save the pattern permanently and
any changes will be lost if you load another project. If you wish to save your changes per-
manently, you should use SAVE TO PROJ in the PATTERN MENU. For more information,
please see “13.3 PATTERN MENU” on page 73.
```
#### 10.12.7 TRACK TRANSPOSE

1. Press and hold [FUNC] and then press [+]/[−] to initiate transpose of the active track in semitones.
    Press and hold [TRK] + [FUNC] and then press [+]/[−] to initiate transpose of the active track in
    octaves.

### 11.2 TRIG PAGE

Here you set the options for notes that are trigged. This is also where you select trig conditions. Press the
[TRIG PARAMETERS] key to access the menu. Change settings using the DATA ENTRY knobs. These
general settings affect note trigs placed on the sequencer.

##### NOTE

```
Trig Note sets the pitch of the note when trigged. When in LIVE RECORDING mode and playing in KEY-
BOARD mode, the pitch of the [TRIG] keys played will override this setting. Press and turn DATA ENTRY
knob A to select only note values that exist in the scale set by KB SCALE. This behavior can be inverted
using the NOTE PARAM setting in the PERSONALIZE menu. For more information, please see “13.7.6
NOTE PARAM” on page 79 and “8.5.2 KEYBOARD SETUP MENU” on page 25.
```
```
VEL
Trig Velocity sets the velocity of the sequencer’s note trigs.
```
```
LEN
Trig Length sets the length of the note trig. In LIVE RECORDING mode, the duration of pressing the
[TRIG] keys overrides this general setting.
```
```
PROB
Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track plays or not. The probability outcome is
re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is 100%, meaning that all the trigs on the
track plays every time. This parameter can be parameter locked which lets you give separate trigs their
own probability.
```
```
L F O.T
LFO Trig controls if the LFO will be trigged or not.
```

##### 11. TRACK PARAMETERS

##### F LT.T

```
Filter Trig controls if the filter envelope will be trigged or not.
```
```
FILL
Fill is a separate trig condition that determines if a trig is active (plays) or not depending on if the device
is in FILL mode or not. For more information, please see “10.12.4 FILL MODE” on page 52, and “10.12.3
TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS” on page 51.
ON, A trig with FILL set to ON, plays when FILL mode is active.
OFF, A trig with FILL set to OFF plays when FILL mode is not active.
```
```
The sequencer needs to be in FILL mode to activate the FILL trig condition. For more
information, please see “10.12.4 FILL MODE” on page 52.
```
##### COND

```
(Trig Condition) when you add a conditional lock, COND sets the Trig Condition with which a set of con-
ditional rules can be applied to any trig, using a conditional parameter lock. For more information, please
see “10.12.3 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS” on page 51.
```
### 11.3 TRIG PAGE

```
Here you set the behavior of retrigs that are added to note trigs placed in the sequencer. On this page you
also control the portamento. Change settings using the DATA ENTRY knobs. These general settings all
affect note trigs placed in the sequencer.
Retrigs can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on the audio tracks (the retrig function is not
available on the MIDI tracks). In GRID RECORDING mode, press [TRIG PARAMETERS] twice to access the
RETRIG PARAMETERS page. Hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then set the desired retrig options for
the trig(s). The RETRIG PARAMETERS page shows the retrig actions for the chosen sequencer step(s) on
the active track. The retrig settings are stored in the active pattern.
```
##### RTRG

```
Retrig enables a number of trig repeats on placed trigs. Use DATA ENTRY knob A to turn retrig on/off.
For information on setting retrig locks on specific trigs in the sequencer, please see “10.9 RETRIGS” on
page 48.
```
```
VFAD
Velocity Fade sets the velocity curve fade out/fade in of the retrig (-64–64). -64 corresponds to a
complete fade out during the set length, -32 fades out to half the velocity during the set length, 0 equals
a flat velocity curve with no fade, 32 fades into half velocity during the set length and 64 fades in com-
pletely to full velocity during the set length. Please note that the effects of the VFAD setting is also
dependent on the VEL setting on TRIG PAGE 1.
```
```
LEN
Length sets the duration of the retrig velocity curve in fractions of, or rational or integer multiples of, a
step (0,125–INF). 1/16 is the nominal length of one step. This setting affects the behavior of the velocity
curve by defining the boundaries of its envelope.
```
```
R AT E
Rate sets the retrig rate. 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 1/32 corresponds to two trigs
per step and so on. To do triplets, for example, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24).
```

##### 11. TRACK PARAMETERS

##### PTIM

```
Portamento Time sets the time for the portamento.
```
```
PORT
Portamento turns the portamento on/off. Please note that this parameter is only available on audio
tracks.

    frequency range.
- With WDTH set to 0, the filter functions as a band pass filter with BASE adjusting the
    frequency.
- With BASE set to 0 and WDTH set to 127 the filter does not affect the sound.

```
DEL
Envelope delay sets the time before the attack phase of the filter envelope starts. This parameter is part
of the filter envelope that controls the FLTR machine. You can also press and hold [FUNC] and then turn
DATA ENTRY knob A to quickly access this parameter from FLTR page 1. This parameter only affects the
selected filter machine on FLTR page 1.
```
```
KEY.T

KEY.T setting, the more the filter opens up at higher notes. This parameter only affects the selected filter
machine on FLTR page 1.
```
```
BASE
Sets the base frequency of the filter.
```
```
WDTH
Sets the frequency width above the base frequency.
```
```
BW.RT
BW Routing selects if the base-width filter should be routed before (Pre) or after (Post) the machine
selectable filter in the audio path.
```
```
RSET
Filter Envelope Reset sets the filter envelope behavior. This parameter only affects the selected filter
machine on FLTR page 1.
ON resets the envelope for each consecutive trig (default). The envelopes attack phase is reset to zero.
OFF does not reset the envelope for each consecutive trig. The envelopes attack phase continues
from where it was left off.
```
### 11.7 AMP PAGE

```
The AMP page controls parameters for the amplitude envelope, panning, and volume.
Press [AMP] to access this parameter page.
```

##### 11. TRACK PARAMETERS

##### AT K

Attack Time sets the length of the attack phase of the amp envelope.

HOLD

Hold Time sets the length of the hold phase of the amp envelope. Fixed Hold time values (0–126) specify
the length of the hold phase, and the envelope ignores Note Off events such as Trig Length, releasing a
[TRIG] key or a key on an external controller. Setting HOLD to NOTE means the hold phase will be deter-
mined by Note On and Note Off events. This parameter is only available if MODE is set to AHD.

```
If you set HOLD to NOTE and use an external keyboard to trigger the envelope, then the
sound will be sustained (if DEC is set to less than 127) for as long as you press a key on the
keyboard.
```
DEC

Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the amp envelope.

SUS

Sustain Level sets the sustain level of the amp envelope. This parameter is only available if MODE on is
set to ADSR.

REL

Release Time sets the length of the release phase of the amp envelope. This parameter is only available
if MODE is set to ADSR.

RSET

Amp envelope reset sets the amp envelope behavior:

```
ON resets the envelope for each consecutive trig (default). The envelopes attack phase is reset to zero.
OFF does not reset the envelopes for each consecutive trig. The envelopes attack phase continues
from where it was left off..
```
MODE
Envelope mode sets the amplitude envelope to function as an AHD or an ADSR envelope.

PAN

Pan positions the audio in the stereo field.

##### 11. TRACK PARAMETERS

### 11.9 MOD PAGE

The MOD pages contain three LFOs (two for tracks that use MIDI machines). The Low-Frequency Oscilla-
tor can be used to modulate track parameters. Customize the low-frequency oscillator behavior, orientation,
speed, and depth on this page. This page controls the behavior of LFO 1

Press [MOD] to access this parameter page.

##### SPD

```
Speed sets the speed of the LFO. Try settings of 8, 16 or 32 to sync the LFO to straight beats. The knob
is bipolar. The LFO cycle can be played backward by using negative values.
```
```
MULT
Multiplier multiplies the SPD parameter by the set factor either by multiplying the current tempo (BPM
settings), or by multiplying a fixed tempo of 120 BPM.
```
```
FADE
Fade In/Out makes it possible to fade in/fade out the LFO modulation. The knob is bipolar. Positive val-
ues give a fade-out, negative values give a fade in. 0 gives no fade in/fade out. (-64–63)
```
```
DEST
Destination selects the modulation destination for the LFO. Preview how the LFO modulation will affect
the sound by highlighting a destination. Press [YES] to confirm the selection. Press [NO] to cancel and
revert to previous selection. Press [FUNC] and then turn the knob to snap to destination sections. For
more information, please see “APPENDIX D: MODULATION DESTINATIONS” on page 118
```
```
WAV E
Waveform sets the LFO waveform. The Triangle, Sine, Square, Sawtooth, and Random waveforms are
bipolar. The Exponential and Ramp are unipolar.
```
```
SPH
Start Phase sets the point within the wave cycle where the LFO will start when it is trigged. 0 makes the
LFO start at the beginning of a complete wave cycle, 64 makes it start at the center. A small square at
the start of the waveform shows that the wave cycle starts at a zero-crossing. If WAV is set to RND then
the SPH parameter changes to SLEW and adds slew to the transitions in the waveform.
```
```
MODE
Trig Mode sets how the LFO will act when a note is trigged.
```
- FREE is the default free-running mode. It makes the LFO run continuously, never restarting or
stopping even if notes are trigged.
- TRIG makes the LFO restart when a note is trigged.
- HOLD makes the LFO run free in the background, but when a note is trigged the LFO output level is
latched and held still until the next note is trigged.
- ONE The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the end of the waveform and then stops.
This makes the LFO function similar to an envelope.
- HALF The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the middle of the waveform and then stops.

```
DEP
Depth sets the depth and polarity of the LFO modulation. Both negative and positive modulation depth is
possible. A center setting, 0.00, equals no modulation depth.
```

##### 12. FX AND MIXER PARAMETERS

##### X

```
Ping-pong sets the delay signal to alternate across the stereo field. There are two settings:
```
- OFF lets you manually set the position of the delay signal in the stereo field. Use the WID parameter
to change the stereo field position.
- ON makes the delay signal alternate between left and right pan positions. The WID parameter
controls the amount of panning.

```
WID
Stereo Width sets the delay signal pan width across the stereo field. The knob is bipolar.
```
```
FDBK
Feedback Gain sets the amount of delay output signal to feed back into the input of the delay. With high-
er parameter settings, infinite and/or swelling delays are possible. Please be aware that high feedback
can lead to a very loud signal.
```
```

```
### 12.3 REVERB

##### (SEND FX PAGE 2)

```
The Reverb send effect controls the persistence, and ambient characteristics, of the sound reverberations.
It can simulate many different sonic locations, from huge spaces to small rooms.
```
##### PRE

```
Pre-delay sets the pre-delay time of the Reverb.
```
```
DEC
Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the reverberated signal, essentially setting the size of
the simulated acoustic space.
```
```
FREQ
FB Shelving Freq sets the shelving filter frequency. Together with the GAIN parameter, it can be used to
dampen the reverberated signal above a chosen frequency, making the reverberation sound more promi-
nent or more muffled.
```
```
GAIN
FB Shelving Gain affects the damping of the reverberated signal above the shelving frequency set by the
FREQ parameter. At max value the treble is included in the reverberations; lowering the value gradually
dampens it.
```
```
VOL
Reverb Volume sets the volume of the Reverb output signal. Use LEVEL/DATA to set this parameter.
```

##### 12. FX AND MIXER PARAMETERS

##### HPF

```
HPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb high-pass filter that affects the audio going into the reverb.
```
```
LPF
LPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb low-pass filter that affects the audio going into the reverb.
```
### 12.4 CHORUS

##### (SEND FX PAGE 3)

High-pass filter sets the highpass filtering of the input signal.
```
```
WDTH
Width sets the stereo width of the chorus.
```
```
VOL
Chorus Volume sets the volume of the Chorus output signal. Use LEVEL/DATA to set this parameter.
```
```
DEL
Delay Send sets how much of the wet chorus signal to send through to the delay.
```
```
REV
Reverb Send sets how much of the wet chorus signal to send through to the reverb.
```
### 12.5 COMPRESSOR

##### (MIXER PAGE 1)

The Compressor master effect compresses the dynamic range of the signal by reducing the volume of loud
sounds relative to the quiet sounds. There are eight parameters with which the compressor is customized
on this page. There is a bar on the left side of the screen that visually represents the amount gain reduction

##### THR

```
Threshold sets the threshold of the compressor. A lower threshold means a larger portion of the signal is
subject to compression.
```

##### 12. FX AND MIXER PARAMETERS

##### AT K

```
Attack sets the time of the compressor attack phase, i.e. how quickly the compressor responds to loud
peaks.
```
```
REL
Release sets the time of the compressor release phase, i.e. how long it takes for the compression to
recover in quieter moments.
```
```
MUP
Makeup Gain sets the makeup gain of the compressor output, to compensate for the reduced signal
levels caused by compression. The Makeup Gain parameter value is displayed in dB.
```
```
VOL
Pattern Volume sets the kits overall audio level. This parameter basically has the same function as the
MAIN VOLUME knob, but is saved together with the kit. Use LEVEL/DATA to adjust the settings.
```
```
R AT
Compression Ratio. There are eight different compression ratios, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 16.00
and 20.00. Higher ratios result in greater compression of the signal.
```
```
SCS
Sidechain Source decides what audio source the compressor analyzes when it performs sidechaining.
Sidechaining is the process when the compressor uses the output of an audio source to control the
overall action of the compressor. For example, if you set SCS to TRK1 where you have a kick drum, every
time the kick drum plays, the compressor lowers the overall sound of the mix.
COMP MIX sets the sidechain source to be all the tracks that are routed to the compressor.
COMP (Not Comp) sets the sidechain source to be all the tracks that are not routed to the compressor.
TRK1–16 sets the sidechain source to be the sound sent from one of the separate audio tracks.
IN LR sets the sidechain source to be the sound coming from IN L/R.
IN L sets the sidechain source to be the sound coming from INPUT L.
IN R sets the sidechain source to be the sound coming from INPUT R.
```
- The results of the COMP MIX and NOT COMP settings depends on the selections
    you make on the COMPRESSOR ROUTING page. For more information please see
    “9.6.1 KIT” on page 35.
- The IN L and IN R options are only available if you set DUAL on the External mixer
    page to ON. The IN LR option is only available if you set DUAL to OFF. For more infor-
    mation, please see “12.9 EXTERNAL MIXER” on page 70.

```
SCF
Sidechain Filter filters the signal from the sidechain source before the compressor analyzes it. The
parameter ranges from a low-pass filter to a high-pass filter. Negative parameter values set a low-pass
filter. Positive parameter values set a high-pass filter.
When set as a low-pass filter, the compressor reacts mostly to bass frequencies. Use this setting for a
characteristic pumping compressor sound. When set as a high-pass filter, the compressor reacts less to
bass frequencies. Use this setting to avoid pumping.
```
```
DRY/WET MIX
Dry/Wet Mix sets the mix of the uncompressed signal and the compressor output signal. A setting of
0 results in a completely uncompressed signal. A setting of 127 lets only the compressed signal pass
through. All values in between mix the uncompressed signal with the compressed signal, which is known
as parallel compression.

## APPENDIX A: MACHINES

APPENDIX A: MACHINES

A machine is a module within the Digitone II with specific functionality. A machine can be switched out for
another machine in the same category. For example different synthesis engines or filters. Every machine
has a specific set of parameters tailored to give you the most relevant and useful sound-shaping possibili-
ties for that particular machine. For more information, please see “5.3.1 AUDIO TRACKS AND MACHINES”
on page 16

Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to select the parameter group's pages. You can also press a [PARAMETER]
key repeatedly to cycle trough the parameter pages in that group. Press and hold a [PARAMETER] key to
see the values for all parameters on that page.

### A.1 ASSIGNING MACHINES TO THE ACTIVE TRACK

1. Press [FUNC] + [SYN] to open the MACHINE menu.
2. Use [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to navigate to the desired machine category.
3. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select machine, and then press [YES] to assign the selected machine to the
    track.

The rest of this appendix lists the machine-specific parameters on the SYN and FLTR pages. The selected
machine determines the parameters available.

### A.2 SYN MACHINES

The SYN machines are different synthesis engines with unique functionalities. In this section you also find
the MIDI machine that lets you control external, MIDI equipped, gear. For more information, please see
“5.3.2 MIDI TRACKS” on page 17. You can assign any SYN machine to any track. Press [SYN] to access
these parameter pages.

#### A.2.1 FM TONE

```
The Digitone II's FM TONE machine is a four operator Frequency Modulation (FM) synth in the style of
the classic 80s implementations. However, unlike the early FM synths, the Digitone II use its FM engine
more like a complex tone generator than a complete synthesizer voice (although it does have this capa-
bility too). The Digitone II signal path is more similar to a typical subtractive synth than a classic FM voice.
```
```
PAGE 1
The parameters on the page 1 control various aspects of the FM engine. You can find more informa-
tion about the Digitone II FM synthesis in “APPENDIX B: THE FM TONE SYNTHESIS” on page 106.
```
##### ALGO

```
Algorithm selects the structure of how the four operators are connected to each other.
For more information, please see “B.3 ALGORITHMS” on page 107.
```
```
RATIO C
Sets the frequency ratio for operator C. For more information, please see “B.4 FM RATIOS” on page
107.
```

##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

##### RATIO A

```
Sets the frequency ratio for operator A. For more information, please see “B.4 FM RATIOS” on page
107.
```
```
RATIO B
Sets the frequency ratio for operator B1 and B2. The minimum value for B1 and B2 is .25. As you
turn the encoder, B2 increases until it reaches the max (16). It then starts over from .25 and B1
increases to the next value (0.5). This revolving behavior continues until both operators reach
the maximum value. This parameter behavior is similar to the movement of the hands on a watch.
(0.25–16.0) For more information, please see “B.4 FM RATIOS” on page 107.
```
```
HARM
Harmonics controls waveform of the operators, C, A, and B1. The parameter is bipolar. Negative
parameter values change the harmonics of operator C, while positive parameter values change the
harmonics of operators A and B1. (-26.00–26.00) For more information, please see “B.6 HARMON-
ICS” on page 109.
```
```
DTUN
Detune offsets the ratio of operator A and B2. Up to a parameter value of around 64, the offset is
very slight to achieve subtle movement. Above 64 the operators start to detune more heavily.
```
```
FDBK
Feedback sets the amount of self modulation of the operator that has feedback. This operator is
shown in the algorithm on the screen with a feedback loop in its upper left corner. For more infor-
mation, please see “B.2 OPERATORS” on page 106.
```
```
MIX
Each algorithm has two carrier outputs (X and Y) that come from two different operators depend-
ing on what algorithm you chose. Use the MIX parameter to mix between these outputs so that
you can cross-fade between two separate timbres. (-64–63). For more information, please see For
more information, please see “B.3 ALGORITHMS” on page 107.
```
```
PAGE 2
The parameters on the page 2 control various aspects of the FM synthesis, mainly the amount of
frequency modulation together with the operator envelopes.
The FM engine has two operator envelopes. One is for operator group A, and one is for group B (B1
and B2). The envelopes are essentially expanded AD (Attack Decay) envelopes, but with an added
adjustable end level (the amplitude level the sound reaches at the end of the decay stage). For more
information, please see “B.5 OPERATOR ENVELOPES” on page 108.
```
##### AT K (A)

```
Attack Time sets the length of the attack phase of the modulation envelope for operator A.
```
```
DEC (A)
Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the modulation envelope for operator A.
```
```
END (A)
End Level sets the end level of the modulation envelope for operator A.
```
```
LEV (A)
Level sets the modulation amount from operator A.
```
```
ATK (B)
Attack Time sets the length of the attack phase of the modulation envelope for operator group B
(B1 and B2).
```

##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

##### DEC (B)

```
Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the modulation envelope for operator group B
(B1 and B2).
```
```
END (B)
End Level sets the end level of the modulation envelope for operator group B (B1 and B2).
```
```
LEV (B)
Level sets the modulation amount from operator group B (B1 and B2).
The LEVEL parameter for B is macro mapped to both operator B1 and B2 and control their modula-
tion amount as per this graph:
```
```
B1
B2
```
```
Level
Parameter value 43 64 85
```
##### 0

##### 127

```
If you wish to use frequency modulation, it is important that you turn the LEV parame-
ters up, since they set the amount of frequency modulation in the FM engine.
```
##### PAGE 3

The parameters on the page 3 control various aspects of the FM synthesis, mainly the amount of
frequency modulation together with the operator envelopes and their behavior.

##### ADEL

```
Envelope delay sets the time before attack phase of the modulation envelope for operator A starts.
```
```
Delay Attack Decay End level
```
##### ATRG

```
Envelope trig sets the trig behavior of the operator envelopes. The envelopes can be either trig-
gered or gated - making it either an ADE (Attack Decay End) or an ASDE (Attack Sustain Decay
End) envelope. The sustain phase does not have an adjustable envelope level. It is instead the LEV
parameter that sets the sustain level. The note length defines the length of the sustain phase.

KEY TRACK A
Key track sets the level of how much the modulation output from operator A is affected by what
note you play on the keyboard. If you set key track to 0, the modulation level is the same for all
keys. A higher setting decreases the modulation level more and more the higher you play the key-
board. So, a lower level of modulation decreases the complexity of the tone in the higher frequen-
cies, which is a typical behavior in many acoustic instruments.

noise design.
```
```

```
##### TUN1

```
Osc1 Tune sets the pitch of oscillator 1.
```
```
WAV1
OSC1 Waveform sets the waveform for oscillator 1. The waveform crossfades between the differ-
ent waveforms. Which waveforms you can select here depends on what wavetable you select with
TBL1.
```
```
PD1
Osc1 Phase Distortion controls the amount of phase distortion of oscillator 1. Think of it as chang-
ing the pulse width, but on any waveform, not just square waves.
```
```
LEV1
Osc1 Level sets the level of oscillator 1.
```
```
TUN2
Osc2 Tune sets the pitch of oscillator 2.
```
```
WAV2
Osc2 Waveform sets the waveform for oscillator 2. The waveform crossfades between the differ-
ent waveforms. Which waveforms you can select here depends on what wavetable you select with
TBL2.
```
```
PD2
Osc2 Phase Distortion controls the amount of phase distortion of oscillator 2. Think of it as chang-
ing the pulse width, but on any waveform, not just square waves.
```
```
LEV2
Osc2 Level sets the level of oscillator 2.
```
```
Phase distortion makes the oscillator traverse the first and second half of the
waveform at different speeds, effectively distorting the waveshape by dragging its
midpoint towards the start or end. A simple example is the squarewave, where phase
distortion acts a pulsewidth parameter adjusting the duty cycle of the waveform.
```

##### APPENDIX A: MACHINES

##### PAGE 2

##### OFS1

```
Osc1 Lin Offset sets an offset of oscillator 1 tuning. This parameter offsets the frequency of the
oscillator linearly in hertz (unlike TUNE which adjusts the pitch in cents). This feature gives more
noticeable detune in lower notes than higher. It allows for a different kind of chorus-like detune,
since the beating frequency does not vary with the pitch.
```
```
TBL1
Osc1 Wavetable selects the wavetable for the oscillator 1 WAVE parameter. PRIM contains the ba-
sic oscillator waves Sin, Tri, Saw, Square. HARM contains a long list of waveforms sweeping across
other combinations of harmonics.
```
```
MOD
Oscillator Modulation selects how the two oscillators can interact with each other. The settings are
OFF, RING MOD, RING MODE FIXED (Osc 2 does not track note values), and HARD SYNC.
```
```
In RING MOD mode, Oscillator 2 is modulating Oscillator 1. In that configuration, you
most often don’t want to hear the modulator, so you would turn down LEV2 to 0.
TUN1 will adjust the tuning of the sound, while TUN2 will change the sound. Even if
LEV2 is set to 0, adjusting WAV2 and PD2 will impact the timbre of the sound.
In HARD SYNC mode, Oscillator 1’s phase is reset every time Oscillator 2’s waveform
starts a new cycle. In this mode, TUN2 controls the tuning of the sound, and TUN1 will
control another aspect of the sound, that may sound a bit like a filter with resonance
when modulated.
```
```
RSET
Oscillator Phase Reset sets if and how the oscillator's wave phase resets when you play a note.
OFF does not reset the oscillator phase. ON resets the oscillators to the start of their waveform
phase. RAND resets the oscillators to a random position in the waveform phase.
```
```
OFS2
Osc2 Lin Offset sets an offset of oscillator 2 tune. This parameter offsets the frequency of the
oscillator linearly in hertz (unlike TUNE which adjusts the pitch in cents). This feature gives more
noticeable detune in lower notes than higher. It allows for a different kind of chorus-like detune,
since the beating frequency does not vary with the pitch.
```

Osc2 Wavetable selects the wavetable for the oscillator 2 WAVE parameter. PRIM contains the ba-
sic oscillator waves Sin, Tri, Saw, Square. HARM contains a long list of waveforms sweeping across
other combinations of harmonics.

Oscillator Drift sets the amount of random pitch drift of oscillator 1 and 2.
```

##### AT K

```
Noise Attack sets the length of the attack phase of the noise amp envelope.
```
```
HOLD
Noise Hold sets the length of the hold phase of the noise amp envelope. Fixed Hold time values
(0–126) specify the length of the hold phase, and the envelope ignores Note Off events such as Trig
Length, releasing a [TRIG] key or a key on an external controller. Setting HOLD to NOTE means the
hold phase will be determined by Note On and Note Off events.
```
```
If you set HOLD to NOTE and use an external keyboard to trigger the envelope, then
the sound will be sustained (if DEC is set to less than 127) for as long as you press a
key on the keyboard.
```
```
DEC
Noise Decay sets the length of the decay phase of the noise amp envelope.
```
```
NLEV
Noise Level sets the level of the noise part of the sound.
```
```
BASE
Noise Base sets the base frequency for the noise filter.
```
```
WDTH
Noise Width sets the frequency width above the base frequency for the noise filter.
```
```
TYPE
Noise Type selects between three different types of noise, GRAIN, TUNED (a Sample and Hold that
tracks the pitch, and S&H (Sample and Hold).
```
```
CHAR
Noise Character changes the character of the noise. The effect of this parameter vary depending
on the selected TYPE.
GRAIN, Character sets the density of the grain, from white noise to very grainy.
TUNED, Character sets the base tuning of the sample & hold that are then tracked by pitch.
S&H, Character sets the fixed tuning of the sample and hold.
```
#### A.2.4 SWARMER

The SWARMER machine is based on using one main oscillator and a swarm of six additional detuned
oscillators to create a rich sound.

unchanged.
```
```

```
```
DET

pitch unchanged.
```
```

Main Waveform sets the waveform of the main oscillator.
```
```

modulated separately in pairs by hidden LFOs running at different rates.
```
```
N.MOD
Noise Modulation sets the amount of noise modulation of the detuned swarm oscillators.
```

[TRIG] keys overrides this general setting.
```
```
PROB
Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track plays or not. The probability outcome
is re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is 100%, meaning that all the trigs
on the track plays every time. This parameter can be parameter locked which lets you give separate
trigs their own probability.
```
```
L F O.T
LFO Trig controls if the LFO will be trigged or not.
```
```
FILL
Fill is a separate trig condition that determines if a trig is active (plays) or not depending on if the
device is in FILL mode or not. For more information, please see “10.12.4 FILL MODE” on page 52,
and “10.12.3 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS” on page 51.

## APPENDIX B: THE FM TONE SYNTHESIS

APPENDIX B: THE FM TONE SYNTHESIS

### B.1 OVERVIEW

```
The Digitone II's FM TONE machine is a four operator Frequency Modulation (FM) synth in the style of the
classic 80s implementations. However, unlike the early FM synths, the Digitone II use its FM engine more
like a complex tone generator than a complete synthesizer voice (although it does have this capability too).
The Digitone II signal path is more similar to a typical subtractive synth than a classic FM voice.
```
```
FM Overdrive Multimode
Filter
```
```
Base-width
Filter
```
```
Amp
```
```
The idea of this design is to harness the raw, and often complex, soundscapes of FM synthesis and use a
more well-known and approachable subtractive method for the overall sound shaping.
FM is a synthesis method where you add harmonics to the timbre by using modulation or layering to shape
the sound. You add harmonics by modulating one oscillator’s pitch with the output of another oscillator. FM
works similarly to how you would apply vibrato via an LFO. At slower modulation rates, it is simply vibrato,
but when the modulating frequency reaches audio rate, the vibrato effects becomes a part of the sound and
becomes a timbral effect instead.
```
### B.2 OPERATORS

```
In FM synthesis the oscillators are called operators. Unlike the analog oscillator, the operator also contains
an envelope and specific input and outputs, making it a sort of macro oscillator. FM combines two or more
operators to generate a more harmonically rich output. An operator that is used to modulate another opera-
tor is called a modulator. The operator that generates, or carries, the resulting tone is called a carrier.
Feedback is used to increase the sharpness of a sound and is usually only applied to modulators. The
output of the operator is fed back into itself, resulting in added harmonics. For example, have a look at the
Sounds B001 and B002 in the Digitone II to see how feedback is used to create a basic square and saw
waveform. For more information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.

##### APPENDIX B: THE FM TONE SYNTHESIS

In some instances, an operator can be both carrier and modulator. This means that it outputs its result as a
tone while also using it to modulate another operator. We have divided the operators into three groups: C, A,
and B (B1 and B2) to lessen the complexity and make the Digitone II easier to use. Since group B consist of
two operators, the parameter controls for B are macro mapped to both operators.

### B.3 ALGORITHMS

An algorithm is a set routing, or combination, of the operators. Routing the modulation in different ways
gives you several different methods of applying modulation and naturally different results.

```
Pictured above is a 2 operator algorithm, which is FM synthesis in its most basic form. The Digitone II has
four operators available which can be routed in many different ways. Different algorithms dramatically
changes the characteristics of the output - for example stacking four operators can lead to very complex
timbres.

The Digitone II has eight different algorithms where the four operators are routed in different ways. For
more information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89. Each algorithm has two carrier outputs (X
and Y) that come from two different operators depending on what algorithm you chose. It is possible to
use the MIX parameter to mix between these outputs so that you can cross-fade between two separate
timbres. For more information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.

The lines going to X and Y indicate the output from a carrier. There are two different ways a carrier output
is sent to the X/Y outputs: 1. Its amplitude is unaffected by the operator envelope (dotted line). 2. Its ampli-
tude is affected by the operator envelope (filled line). The sound from the X/Y outputs is then routed via the
overdrive to the filters.

### B.4 FM RATIOS

Frequency modulation is applied in multipliers of the principal frequency to retain the sounds tonality. These
multipliers are known as ratios. Each operator group’s ratio is a multiplier of the input pitch (note value). The
higher the ratio, the higher the pitch frequency. For example, when applying modulation with a ratio of 1:2
(carrier:modulator), the carrier output resembles a square wave. A ratio of 1:1 sounds like a sawtooth, and
odd numbers can be used for various metallic or other “natural” sounds. In Digitone II, the FM ratios for the
different operator groups works like this:


##### APPENDIX B: THE FM TONE SYNTHESIS

```
C which always works like a carrier, is limited mostly to integers since it is generally used for carrying the
base note of the sound. For more information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.
A has a more extensive number of ratio values to allow for more inharmonic relationships. For more informa-
tion, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.
B (B1 and B2) controls both operators at the same time. The minimum value for B1 and B2 is .25. As you
turn the encoder, B2 increases until it reaches the max (16). It then starts over from .25 and B1 increases to
the next value (0.5). This revolving behavior continues until both operators reach the maximum value. This
parameter behavior is similar to the movement of the hands on a watch. For more information, please see
“A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.
```
### B.5 OPERATOR ENVELOPES

```
If you modulate one oscillator directly with another it creates very harsh harmonics, so you need to limit the
modulation level to control the amount of modulation. In Digitone II you use an envelope and a LEVEL pa-
rameter control to attenuate the amount of how much the modulator affects the carrier. The envelopes also
give the possibility to control the modulation over time. A piano for example, when first struck, the timbre is
sharp but quickly fades to a softer tone. Envelopes and modulation level are vital elements in FM synthesis
and are the tools that you use to shape the sounds you want to achieve.
The Digitone II FM engine has two operator envelopes that are designed to be practical and easy to use.
One envelope is for operator group A, and one is for group B (B1 and B2).
The envelopes are essentially expanded AD (Attack Decay) envelopes, but with an added adjustable end
level (the amplitude level the sound reaches at the end of the decay stage). Normally, an AD envelope al-
ways ends at zero level, but with FM you often want to retain some modulation after a short pluck or fade in
for example. For more information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.
```
```
Please note that operator envelope B controls the output from both B1 and B2.
```
```
The envelopes can be either triggered or gated - making it either an ADE (Attack Decay End) or an ASDE
(Attack Sustain Decay End) envelope. The sustain phase does not have an envelope level. It is instead the
LEV parameter that sets the sustain level. The note length defines the length of the sustain phase. For more
information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.

### B.6 HARMONICS

The default output from an operator is a sine wave, but you can use the HARM parameter to add upper
partials to some of the operators’ sine waves to create more harmonically rich waveforms. The HARM pa-
rameter is bipolar. Negative parameter values change the harmonics of operator C, while positive parameter
values change the harmonics of operators A and B1.

Harm - Harm +

When changing harmonics, intermediate values interpolates between the current and the next harmonic.
This interpolation works much like in wavetable synthesis, sweeping between the harmonics, smoothly
transitioning from one timbre to another. For more information, please see “A.2.1 FM TONE” on page 89.
The harmonic series for the operators looks like this:

The Digitone II uses a form of additive synthesis to create the harmonic series for the HARM parameter.
Additive synthesis is one of the oldest forms of electronic sound generation. It is a quite simple form of
synthesis but still very powerful. The basic principle is to add multiple sine waves together to form complex
timbres. Each sine wave is called a partial. By attenuating each partial, the timbre changes its harmonic
content, resulting in different waveforms.
```
```
The first partial is always kept
at full volume, which keeps the
base octave intact.
```
```
The first partial is always
kept at full volume,
which keeps the base
octave intact.
```
```
Adding every partial in
series will replicate a
sawtooth. Note how the
volume decreases for
each partial, creating a
natural falloff.
```
```
Adding every odd partial in
series will approximate a
squarewave.
```
```
This method can be used
to make all sorts of timbres.
This for example sounds
close to a bell tone.
